     AX_CXX_LDFLAGS_STD_LANG(LD-FLAGS)

Description
***********

Append to LD-FLAGS the set of link-time flags that should be passed to
the C++ compiler in order to enable use of C++ features as defined in
the ANSI C++ standard (eg. use of standard iostream classes in the `std'
namespace, etc.). Note that if you use GNU Libtool you may need to
prefix each of those switches with `-Xlinker' so that Libtool doesn't
discard them (see Libtool's manual and `AC_LIBTOOLIZE_LDFLAGS').

Synopsis

     AX_DEFINE_INTEGER_BITS (TYPE [, CANDIDATE-TYPE]...)

Description
***********

Given a TYPE of the form "int##_t" or "uint##_t", see if the datatype
TYPE is predefined. If not, then define TYPE - both with AC_DEFINE and
as a shell variable - to the first datatype of exactly ## bits in a
list of CANDIDATE-TYPEs. If none of the CANDIDATE-TYPEs contains exactly
## bits, then set the TYPE shell variable to "no".

For example, the following ensures that uint64_t is defined as a 64-bit
datatype:

         AX_DEFINE_INTEGER_BITS(uint64_t, unsigned long long, unsigned __int64, long)
         if test "$uint64_t" = no; then
           AC_MSG_ERROR([unable to continue without a 64-bit datatype])
         fi

You should then put the following in your C code to ensure that all
datatypes defined by AX_DEFINE_INTEGER_BITS are visible to your program:

         #include "config.h"

         #if HAVE_INTTYPES_H
         # include <inttypes.h>
         #else
         # if HAVE_STDINT_H
         #  include <stdint.h>

ax_define_sub_path
******************

Synopsis
********

     AX_DEFINE_SUB_PATH(DEFNAME, varname, description)

Description
***********

Look at varname and detect the subpath that it contains relative to
$prefix/$exec_prefix. If the path is indeed relative to
$prefix/$exec_prefix, then a single "./" (dotslash) is prepended,
otherwise it can be seen as an absolute path that can not be moved,
which you possibly do for "/etc" files, or even those ending up in
"/lib/modules" or "/winnt/system".

This macro is not very intelligent, it's just a first try in this
direction. It does currently just look into the current patterns, and
replaces a ${prefix} with a simple dot. Amazingly, it works quite well
for most packages.

Example (configure.ac):

        AX_DEFINE_DIR([EPREFIX], [exec_prefix], [--exec-prefix or default])
        AX_DEFINE_SUB_PATH([PATH_LIBDIR], [libdir], [--bindir subdir])
        AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED([PACKAGE],"$PACKAGE", [Name of package])

Example (in C):

        static const char _libdir[] = PATH_LIBDIR; /* configure default */
        char* libdir;
        char* eprefix = getenv (PACKAGE "DIR");
        if (! eprefix) eprefix = EPREFIX; /* default */
        if (*_libdir != '.') libdir = strdup(_libdir);
        else {
           libdir = malloc(strlen(eprefix) + strlen(_libdir) + 2);
           strcpy(libdir, eprefix);
           strcat(libdir, PATH_DELIMITER_STRING);
           strcat(libdir, _libdir);
        }
        ...
        free (libdir);

The AX_DEFINE_SUB_PATHS(varnames) macro looks for the given various
install-paths that largely depend on either ${prefix} or ${exec_prefix}.
Just cut out the prefix and ac_define the value. The value is uppercased
and PATH_ prepended ie. ax_define_sub_paths(bindir libdir pkgdatadir)
will create the defines PATH_BINDIR PATH_LIBDIR PATH_PKGDATADIR - see
posix' include/paths.h that creates _PATH_DEV and friends.

******************

Synopsis

     AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR [(dirstring-or-command [,Makefile.mk [,-all]])]

Description
***********

If the current configure was run within the srcdir then we move all
configure-files into a subdir and let the configure steps continue
there. We provide an option -disable-builddir to suppress the move into
a separate builddir.

Defaults:

       $1 = $host (overridden with $HOST)
       $2 = Makefile.mk
       $3 = -all

This macro must be called before AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE. It creates a default
toplevel srcdir Makefile from the information found in the created
toplevel builddir Makefile. It just copies the variables and
rule-targets, each extended with a default rule-execution that recurses
into the build directory of the current "HOST". You can override the
auto-dection through `config.guess` and build-time of course, as in

       make HOST=i386-mingw-cross

which can of course set at configure time as well using

       configure --host=i386-mingw-cross

After the default has been created, additional rules can be appended
that will not just recurse into the subdirectories and only ever exist
in the srcdir toplevel makefile - these parts are read from the $2 =
Makefile.mk file

The automatic rules are usually scanning the toplevel Makefile for lines
like '#### $host |$builddir' to recognize the place where to recurse
into. Usually, the last one is the only one used. However, almost all
targets have an additional "*-all" rule which makes the script to
recurse into _all_ variants of the current HOST (!!) setting. The "-all"
suffix can be overriden for the macro as well.

a special rule is only given for things like "dist" that will copy the
tarball from the builddir to the sourcedir (or $(PUB)) for reason of
convenience.

****************

Synopsis
********

     AX_EXPAND_PREFIX

Description
***********

When $prefix and $exec_prefix are still set to NONE then set them to the
usual default values - being based on $ac_default_prefix. - this macro
can be AC_REQUIREd by other macros that need to compute values for
installation directories. It has been observed that it was done wrong
over and over again, so this is a bit more safe to do.

remember - setting exec_prefix='${prefix}' needs you interpolate
directories multiple times, it is not sufficient to just say
MYVAR="${datadir}/putter" but you do have to run `eval` a few times,
sth. like MYVAR=`eval "echo \"$MYVAR\""` done atleast two times.

The implementation of this macro simply picks up the lines that would be
run at the start of AC_OUTPUT anyway to set the prefix/exec_prefix
defaults. Between AC_INIT and the first command to AC_REQUIRE this macro
you can set the two variables to something explicit instead. Probably,
any command to compute installation directories should be run _after_
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

AX_EXT_HAVE_LIB is identical to AC_SEARCH_LIBS with the exception that
will add -L<directory> when looking, and use a different variable for
each directory.

Any required -L<directory> flags are added to LDFLAGS and located
libraies are added to LIBS

Some libraries are unlinkable without other extra libraries, which can
be specified in the 4th argument. The mysql client library needs -lz,
for example.

Example:

      AX_EXT_HAVE_LIB(/lib /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/lib/mysql /usr/local/mysql/lib, mysqlclient, mysql_init, [-lz])

which finds the mysql client library if succeds system when it tries
with -L/usr/lib/mysql then it adds -lmysqlclient to LIBS and
-L/usr/lib/mysql to LDFLAGS.

The test itself is based on the autoconf 2.53 version of AC_SEARCH_LIBS.

Allow support for custom dist targets.

To add custom dist targets, you must create a dist-<TYPE> target within
your Makefile.am, where <TYPE> is the name of the dist and then add
<TYPE> to EXTRA_SRC_DISTS or EXTRA_BIN_DISTS. For example:

        dist-foobar:
        	<rules for making the foobar dist>

        EXTRA_BIN_DISTS += foobar

You can then build all the src dist targets by running:

        make dist-src

You can build all the binary dist targets by running:

        make dist-bin

and you can build both the src and dist targets by running:

        make all-dist

Synopsis

     AX_F77_CMAIN_FFLAGS([ACTION-IF-SUCCEED], [ACTION-IF-FAIL])

Description
***********

This macro figures out if extra Fortran compiler flags are required in
order to use the Fortran linker to link programs where the main()
function is defined via C (or other language). On some systems, notably
the Alpha with Compaq compilers, the Fortran libraries have their own
main() function which must be disabled.

Runs ACTION-IF-SUCCEED if successful, and ACTION-IF-FAIL if not. Defines
the output variable F77_CMAIN_FFLAGS to any discovered flags. (If
ACTION-IF-FAIL is not specified, defaults to halting with an error.)

This macro is especially useful in conjunction with automake, since by
default automake uses $F77 to link programs mixing C and Fortran,
leading to a link error on some systems. In this case, you should set
the FFLAGS for that program to include F77_CMAIN_FFLAGS.

     AX_F90_LIBRARY_SETUP(LIBRARY, HEADER-REGEXP, MODULE-REGEXP, LIB-REGEXP, FUNCTION-BODY)

Description
***********

Convenience macro to set up a fortran 90 library in a simplified way.
LIBRARY is the name of the library. HEADER-REGEXP is a regular
expression (used by find) matched by the header file to look for (may be
empty). MODULE-REGEXP is a regular expression (used by find) matched by
the filename of the module (may be empty). LIB-REGEXP is a regular
expression (used by find) matched by the filename of the library, this
is useful either if the library filename does not follow the traditional
libxxx.a or libxxx.so pattern, or if some specific information is
embedded into the name, like compiler used, debugging status ...).
FUNCTION-BODY is the body of a function (including the 'use' statements
and the call to a function defined by the library).

This macro is a simple wrapper around AX_F90_MODULE and AX_F90_LIBRARY
that uses the parameters provided by the end user through a -with-xxx
option to set up the search path. Both a module and a library will be
tested, the same path will be used for both tests, so the path must be
set up with a common parent directory of both the library file and the
module file. The macro also automatically updates the FCFLAGS, LDFLAGS
and LIBS variables in addition to providing the F90_HEADER_xxx,
F90_MODULE_xxx, F90_LDFLAGS_xxx and F90_LIBS_xxx output variables.

Example: suppose you have /home/nostradamus/esoteric/lib/libalchemy.a
and /home/nostradamus/esoteric/mod/alchemy.mod which provides a function
transmute_into_gold, you can use the following in you configure.ac:

       AX_F90_MODULE_EXTENSION
       if test x$ax_cv_f90_modext = xunknown ; then

Synopsis
********

     AX_F90_MODULE(MODULE, MODULE-REGEXP, FUNCTION-BODY [, SEARCH-PATH [, ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])

Description
***********

Set up the compiler flags to use a given fortran 90 module MODULE is the
name of the module. MODULE-REGEXP is a regular expression (used by find)
matched by the filename of the module. FUNCTION-BODY is the body of a
function (including the 'use' statement and the call to a function
defined by the module) SEARCH-PATH is a colon-separated list of
directories that will be recursively searched for modules files. If
empty, the search path will be composed of $prefix, $ac_default_prefix,
and all directories exactly one level *above* the directories in
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH (the rationale is that when libraries are put in
/some/path/lib, the modules are often put in a directory like
/some/path/include or /some/path/mod or something similar). An output
variable named F90_MODULE_xxx will be set up with the proper flag for
substitution in Makefiles (xxx is built from the first argument, with
autoconf traditional escapes).

     AX_FUNC_ACCEPT_ARGTYPES

Description
***********

Checks the data types of the three arguments to accept(). Results are
placed into the symbols ACCEPT_TYPE_ARG[123], consistent with the
following example:

           #define ACCEPT_TYPE_ARG2 struct sockaddr *
           #define ACCEPT_TYPE_ARG3 socklen_t *

This macro requires AC_CHECK_HEADERS to have already verified the
presence or absence of sys/types.h and sys/socket.h.

NOTE: This is just a modified version of the AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES
macro. Credit for that one goes to David MacKenzie et. al.

Synopsis
********

     AX_GCC_ARCHFLAG([PORTABLE?], [ACTION-SUCCESS], [ACTION-FAILURE])

Description
***********

This macro tries to guess the "native" arch corresponding to the target
architecture for use with gcc's -march=arch or -mtune=arch flags. If
found, the cache variable $ax_cv_gcc_archflag is set to this flag and
ACTION-SUCCESS is executed; otherwise $ax_cv_gcc_archflag is is set to
"unknown" and ACTION-FAILURE is executed. The default ACTION-SUCCESS is
to add $ax_cv_gcc_archflag to the end of $CFLAGS.

PORTABLE? should be either [yes] (default) or [no]. In the former case,
the flag is set to -mtune (or equivalent) so that the architecture is
only used for tuning, but the instruction set used is still portable. In
the latter case, the flag is set to -march (or equivalent) so that
architecture-specific instructions are enabled.

The user can specify -with-gcc-arch=<arch> in order to override the
macro's choice of architecture, or -without-gcc-arch to disable this.

When cross-compiling, or if $CC is not gcc, then ACTION-FAILURE is
called unless the user specified -with-gcc-arch manually.

Requires macros: AX_CHECK_COMPILER_FLAGS, AX_GCC_X86_CPUID

(The main emphasis here is on recent CPUs, on the principle that doing
high-performance computing on old hardware is uncommon.)

Synopsis
********

     AX_GCC_OPTION(OPTION,EXTRA-OPTIONS,TEST-PROGRAM,ACTION-IF-SUCCESSFUL,ACTION-IF-NOT-SUCCESFUL)

Description
***********

AX_GCC_OPTION checks wheter gcc accepts the passed OPTION. If it accepts
the OPTION then ACTION-IF-SUCCESSFUL will be executed, otherwise
ACTION-IF-UNSUCCESSFUL.

NOTE: This macro will be obsoleted by AX_C_CHECK_FLAG AX_CXX_CHECK_FLAG,
AX_CPP_CHECK_FLAG, AX_CXXCPP_CHECK_FLAG and AX_LD_CHECK_FLAG.

A typical usage should be the following one:

       AX_GCC_OPTION([-fomit-frame-pointer],[],[],[
         AC_MSG_NOTICE([The option is supported])],[
         AC_MSG_NOTICE([No luck this time])
       ])

The macro doesn't discriminate between languages so, if you are testing
for an option that works for C++ but not for C you should use '-x c++'
as EXTRA-OPTIONS:

       AX_GCC_OPTION([-fno-rtti],[-x c++],[],[ ... ],[ ... ])

OPTION is tested against the following code:

       int main()
       {
               return 0;
       }

The optional TEST-PROGRAM comes handy when the default main() is not
suited for the option being checked

So, if you need to test for -fstrict-prototypes option you should
probably use the macro as follows:

       AX_GCC_OPTION([-fstrict-prototypes],[-x c++],[
         int main(int argc, char ** argv)
         {
         	(void) argc;
         	(void) argv;

         	return 0;
         }
       ],[ ... ],[ ... ])

Note that the macro compiles but doesn't link the test program so it is
not suited for checking options that are passed to the linker, like:

       -Wl,-L<a-library-path>

In order to avoid such kind of problems you should think about usinguse
the AX_*_CHECK_FLAG family macros

Synopsis
********

     AX_GCC_X86_CPUID(OP)

Description
***********

On Pentium and later x86 processors, with gcc or a compiler that has a
compatible syntax for inline assembly instructions, run a small program
that executes the cpuid instruction with input OP. This can be used to
detect the CPU type.

On output, the values of the eax, ebx, ecx, and edx registers are stored
as hexadecimal strings as "eax:ebx:ecx:edx" in the cache variable
ax_cv_gcc_x86_cpuid_OP.

If the cpuid instruction fails (because you are running a
cross-compiler, or because you are not using gcc, or because you are on
a processor that doesn't have this instruction), ax_cv_gcc_x86_cpuid_OP
is set to the string "unknown".

This macro mainly exists to be used in AX_GCC_ARCHFLAG.

     AX_HAVE_EPOLL_PWAIT([ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

Description
***********

This macro determines whether the system supports the epoll I/O event
interface. A neat usage example would be:

       AX_HAVE_EPOLL(
         [AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE(epoll)],
         [AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DISABLE(epoll)])
       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(
         [epoll], [This platform supports epoll(7)],
         [HAVE_EPOLL], [This platform supports epoll(7).])

The epoll interface was added to the Linux kernel in version 2.5.45, and
the macro verifies that a kernel newer than this is installed. This
check is somewhat unreliable if <linux/version.h> doesn't match the
running kernel, but it is necessary regardless, because glibc comes with
stubs for the epoll_create(), epoll_wait(), etc. that allow programs to
compile and link even if the kernel is too old; the problem would then
be detected only at runtime.

Linux kernel version 2.6.19 adds the epoll_pwait() call in addition to
epoll_wait(). The availability of that function can be tested with the
second macro. Generally speaking, it is safe to assume that
AX_HAVE_EPOLL would succeed if AX_HAVE_EPOLL_PWAIT has, but not the
other way round.

Description

Search for OpenGL. We search first for Mesa (a GPL'ed version of Mesa)
before a vendor's version of OpenGL, unless we were specifically asked
not to with `-with-Mesa=no' or `-without-Mesa'.

The four "standard" OpenGL libraries are searched for: "-lGL", "-lGLU",
"-lGLX" (or "-lMesaGL", "-lMesaGLU" as the case may be) and "-lglut".

All of the libraries that are found (since "-lglut" or "-lGLX" might be
missing) are added to the shell output variable "GL_LIBS", along with
any other libraries that are necessary to successfully link an OpenGL
application (e.g. the X11 libraries). Care has been taken to make sure
that all of the libraries in "GL_LIBS" are listed in the proper order.

Additionally, the shell output variable "GL_CFLAGS" is set to any flags
(e.g. "-I" flags) that are necessary to successfully compile an OpenGL
application.

The following shell variable (which are not output variables) are also
set to either "yes" or "no" (depending on which libraries were found) to
help you determine exactly what was found.

       have_GL
       have_GLU
       have_GLX

definition of QT_VERSION in qglobal.h. By use of one or more options a
different library may be selected. There are two different sets of
options. Both sets contain the option -with-Qt-lib=LIB which can be
used to force the use of a particular version of the library file when
more than one are available. LIB must be in the form as it would appear
behind the "-l" option to the compiler. Examples for LIB would be
"qt-mt" for the multi-threaded version and "qt" for the regular version.
In addition to this, the first set consists of an option
-with-Qt-dir=DIR which can be used when the installation conforms to
Trolltech's standard installation, which means that header files are in
DIR/include, binary utilities are in DIR/bin and the library is in
DIR/lib. The second set of options can be used to indicate individual
locations for the header files, the binary utilities and the library
file, in addition to the specific version of the library file.

The following shell variable is set to either "yes" or "no":

       have_qt

Additionally, the following variables are exported:

       QT_CXXFLAGS
       QT_LIBS
       QT_MOC
       QT_UIC
       QT_LRELEASE
       QT_LUPDATE
       QT_DIR

which respectively contain an "-I" flag pointing to the Qt include
directory (and "-DQT_THREAD_SUPPORT" when LIB is "qt-mt"), link flags
necessary to link with Qt and X, the name of the meta object compiler
and the user interface compiler both with full path, and finaly the
variable QTDIR as Trolltech likes to see it defined (if possible).

Example lines for Makefile.in:

       CXXFLAGS = @QT_CXXFLAGS@
       MOC      = @QT_MOC@

After the variables have been set, a trial compile and link is performed
to check the correct functioning of the meta object compiler. This test
may fail when the different detected elements stem from different
releases of the Qt framework. In that case, an error message is emitted
and configure stops.

No common variables such as $LIBS or $CFLAGS are polluted.

Options:

-with-Qt-dir=DIR: DIR is equal to $QTDIR if you have followed the
installation instructions of Trolltech. Header files are in DIR/include,
binary utilities are in DIR/bin and the library is in DIR/lib.

-with-Qt-include-dir=DIR: Qt header files are in DIR.

-with-Qt-bin-dir=DIR: Qt utilities such as moc and uic are in DIR.

-with-Qt-lib-dir=DIR: The Qt library is in DIR.

-with-Qt-lib=LIB: Use -lLIB to link with the Qt library.

If some option "=no" or, equivalently, a -without-Qt-* version is given
in stead of a -with-Qt-*, "have_qt" is set to "no" and the other
variables are set to the empty string.

     AX_HAVE_SELECT([ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])
     AX_HAVE_PSELECT([ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

Description
***********

This macro determines whether the system supports the select I/O event
interface. A neat usage example would be:

       AX_HAVE_SELECT(
         [AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE(select)],
         [AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DISABLE(select)])
       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(
         [select], [This platform supports select(7)],
         [HAVE_SELECT], [This platform supports select(7).])

Some systems also have the variant pselect(). The availability of that
function can be tested with the second macro. Generally speaking, it is
safe to assume that AX_HAVE_SELECT would succeed if AX_HAVE_SELECT_PWAIT
has, but not the other way round.

     AX_JAVA_CHECK_CLASS(<class>,<action-if-found>,<action-if-not-found>)

Description
***********

Test if a Java class is available. Based on AX_PROG_JAVAC_WORKS. This
version uses a cache variable which is both compiler, options and
classpath dependent (so if you switch from javac to gcj it correctly
notices and redoes the test).

The macro tries to compile a minimal program importing <class>. Some
newer compilers moan about the failure to use this but fail or produce a
class file anyway. All moaing is sunk to /dev/null since I only wanted
to know if the class could be imported. This is a recommended followup
to AX_CHECK_JAVA_PLUGIN with classpath appropriately adjusted.

macros. This Macro is optional.

Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission. The
general documentation, as well as the sample configure.in, is included
in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.

     AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR

Description
***********

AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR finds include directories needed for compiling
programs using the JNI interface.

JNI include directories are usually in the java distribution This is
deduced from the value of JAVAC. When this macro completes, a list of
directories is left in the variable JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS.

Example usage follows:

         AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR

         for JNI_INCLUDE_DIR in $JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS
         do
                 CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I$JNI_INCLUDE_DIR"
         done

If you want to force a specific compiler:

- at the configure.in level, set JAVAC=yourcompiler before calling
AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR

- at the configure level, setenv JAVAC

Note: This macro can work with the autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
This particular macro is not part of the original set of macros.

*********

Synopsis
********

     AX_LAPACK([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro looks for a library that implements the LAPACK linear-algebra
interface (see http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). On success, it sets the
LAPACK_LIBS output variable to hold the requisite library linkages.

To link with LAPACK, you should link with:

         $LAPACK_LIBS $BLAS_LIBS $LIBS $FLIBS

in that order. BLAS_LIBS is the output variable of the AX_BLAS macro,
called automatically. FLIBS is the output variable of the
AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS macro (called if necessary by AX_BLAS), and is
sometimes necessary in order to link with F77 libraries. Users will also
need to use AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN (see the autoconf manual), for the same
reason.

The user may also use -with-lapack=<lib> in order to use some specific
LAPACK library <lib>. In order to link successfully, however, be aware
that you will probably need to use the same Fortran compiler (which can
be set via the F77 env. var.) as was used to compile the LAPACK and BLAS
libraries.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a LAPACK library
is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
will define HAVE_LAPACK.

Description
***********

This macro searches for the METIS library in the user specified
location. The user may specify the location either by defining the
environment variable METIS or by using the -with-metis option to
configure. If the environment variable is defined it has precedent over
everything else. If no location was specified then it searches in
/usr/lib and /usr/local/lib for the library and in /usr/include and
/usr/local/include for the header files. Upon sucessful completion the
variables METIS_LIB and METIS_INCLUDE are set.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a METIS library is
found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it is
not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
define HAVE_METIS. If ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is not specified then an error
will be generated halting configure.

Searches for the 'nettle' library with the -with... option.

If found, define HAVE_NETTLE and macro NETTLE_LIBS. Also defines
NETTLE_WITH_<algo> for the algorithms found available. Possible
algorithms: AES ARCTWO BLOWFISH CAST128 DES DES3 SERPENT TWOFISH MD2 MD4
MD5 SHA1 SHA256.

The argument is used if no -with...-nettle option is set. Value "yes"
requires the configuration by default. Value "no" does not require it by
default. Value "auto" configures the library only if available.

Description
***********

This macro will check for the existence of OSS Nokalva
(http://www.oss.com/products/). It does this by checking for the header
file asn1.h and the cppsoed library object file. A -with-nokalva option
is supported as well. The following output variables are set with
AC_SUBST:

       NOKALVA_CPPFLAGS
       NOKALVA_LDFLAGS
       NOKALVA_LIBS

You can use them like this in Makefile.am:

       AM_CPPFLAGS = $(NOKALVA_CPPFLAGS)
       AM_LDFLAGS = $(NOKALVA_LDFLAGS)
       program_LDADD = $(NOKALVA_LIBS)

Additionally, the C preprocessor symbol HAVE_NOKALVA will be defined
with AC_DEFINE if Nokalva is available.

Synopsis

     AX_LIB_READLINE

Description
***********

Searches for a readline compatible library. If found, defines
`HAVE_LIBREADLINE'. If the found library has the `add_history' function,
sets also `HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY'. Also checks for the locations of the
necessary include files and sets `HAVE_READLINE_H' or
`HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H' and `HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H' or
'HAVE_HISTORY_H' if the corresponding include files exists.

The libraries that may be readline compatible are `libedit',
`libeditline' and `libreadline'. Sometimes we need to link a termcap
library for readline to work, this macro tests these cases too by trying
to link with `libtermcap', `libcurses' or `libncurses' before giving up.

Here is an example of how to use the information provided by this macro
to perform the necessary includes or declarations in a C file:

       #ifdef HAVE_LIBREADLINE
       #  if defined(HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H)
       #    include <readline/readline.h>
       #  elif defined(HAVE_READLINE_H)
       #    include <readline.h>
       #  else /* !defined(HAVE_READLINE_H) */
       extern char *readline ();
       #  endif /* !defined(HAVE_READLINE_H) */
       char *cmdline = NULL;
       #else /* !defined(HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H) */
         /* no readline */
       #endif /* HAVE_LIBREADLINE */

       #ifdef HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY
       #  if defined(HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H)
       #    include <readline/history.h>
       #  elif defined(HAVE_HISTORY_H)
       #    include <history.h>
       #  else /* !defined(HAVE_HISTORY_H) */
       extern void add_history ();
       extern int write_history ();
       extern int read_history ();
       #  endif /* defined(HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H) */

     AX_LIB_SOCKET_NSL

Description
***********

This macro figures out what libraries are required on this platform to
link sockets programs.

The common cases are not to need any extra libraries, or to need
-lsocket and -lnsl. We need to avoid linking with libnsl unless we need
it, though, since on some OSes where it isn't necessary it will totally
break networking. Unisys also includes gethostbyname() in libsocket but
needs libnsl for socket().

Description
***********

Detect Lua interpreter, headers and libraries, optionally enforcing a
particular range of versions.

AX_WITH_LUA searches for Lua interpreter and defines LUA if found.

AX_LUA_VERSION checks that the version of Lua is at least MIN-VERSION
and less than TOO-BIG-VERSION, if given.

AX_LUA_HEADERS searches for Lua headers and defines HAVE_LUA_H and
HAVE_LUALIB_H if found, and defines LUA_INCLUDE to the preprocessor
flags needed, if any.

AX_LUA_LIBS searches for Lua libraries and defines LUA_LIB if found.

AX_LUA_LIB_VERSION checks that the Lua libraries' version is at least
MIN-VERSION, and less than TOO-BIG-VERSION, if given.

Versions are specified as three-digit integers whose first digit is the
major version and last two are the minor version (the same format as
LUA_VERSION_NUM in lua.h); e.g. 501 for Lua 5.1. The revision (e.g. the
"3" in "5.1.3") is ignored.

The following options are added by these macros:

       --with-lua-prefix=DIR     Lua files are in DIR.
       --with-lua-suffix=ARG     Lua binaries and library files are
                                 suffixed with ARG.

being erroneously triggered. Likewise make libtool-silent when libtool
has been used.

I use the macro quite a lot since some automake versions have the
tendency to try to rerun some autotools on a mere make even when not
quite in -maintainer-mode. That is very annoying. Likewise, a user who
installs from source does not want to see doubled compiler messages.

I did not put an AC_REQUIRE(MAINTAINER_MODE) in here - should I?

     AX_MISSING_PROG(VARIABLE,PROGRAM,[MESSAGE])

Description
***********

Simple wrapper for the AM_MISSING_PROG which displays a warning MESSAGE
if provided. A typical use is the following:

       AS_IF([test -z "$AWK"],[
         AX_MISSING_PROG(AWK,[awk],[awk seems missing ...])
       ])

Programs wrapped with AX_MISSING_PROG should be used only in the package
building phase (because they will be wrapped with the automake 'missing'
script, which will not be installed).

Synopsis

     AX_MPI([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to find out how to compile programs that use MPI
(Message Passing Interface), a standard API for parallel process
communication (see http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/)

On success, it sets the MPICC, MPICXX, MPIF77, or MPIFC output variable
to the name of the MPI compiler, depending upon the current language.
(This may just be $CC/$CXX/$F77/$FC, but is more often something like
mpicc/mpiCC/mpif77/mpif90.) It also sets MPILIBS to any libraries that
are needed for linking MPI (e.g. -lmpi or -lfmpi, if a special
MPICC/MPICXX/MPIF77/MPIFC was not found).

If you want to compile everything with MPI, you should set:

         CC="MPICC" #OR# CXX="MPICXX" #OR# F77="MPIF77" #OR# FC="MPIFC"
         LIBS="$MPILIBS $LIBS"

NOTE: The above assumes that you will use $CC (or whatever) for linking
as well as for compiling. (This is the default for automake and most
Makefiles.)

The user can force a particular library/compiler by setting the
MPICC/MPICXX/MPIF77/MPIFC and/or MPILIBS environment variables.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if an MPI library is
found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run if it is not
found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
define HAVE_MPI.

ax_normalize_path
*****************

Synopsis
********

     AX_NORMALIZE_PATH(VARNAME, [REFERENCE_STRING])

Description
***********

Perform some cleanups on the value of $VARNAME (interpreted as a path):

       - empty paths are changed to '.'
       - trailing slashes are removed
       - repeated slashes are squeezed except a leading doubled slash '//'
         (which might indicate a networked disk on some OS).

REFERENCE_STRING is used to turn '/' into '\' and vice-versa: if
REFERENCE_STRING contains some backslashes, all slashes and backslashes
are turned into backslashes, otherwise they are all turned into slashes.

This makes processing of DOS filenames quite easier, because you can
turn a filename to the Unix notation, make your processing, and turn it
back to original notation.

       filename='A:\FOO\\BAR\'
       old_filename="$filename"
       # Switch to the unix notation
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([filename], ["/"])
       # now we have $filename = 'A:/FOO/BAR' and we can process it as if
       # it was a Unix path.  For instance let's say that you want
       # to append '/subpath':
       filename="$filename/subpath"
       # finally switch back to the original notation
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([filename], ["$old_filename"])
       # now $filename equals to 'A:\FOO\BAR\subpath'

One good reason to make all path processing with the unix convention is
that backslashes have a special meaning in many cases. For instance

       expr 'A:\FOO' : 'A:\Foo'

will return 0 because the second argument is a regex in which
backslashes have to be backslashed. In other words, to have the two
strings to match you should write this instead:

       expr 'A:\Foo' : 'A:\\Foo'

Such behavior makes DOS filenames extremely unpleasant to work with. So
temporary turn your paths to the Unix notation, and revert them to the
original notation after the processing. See the macro
AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS for a concrete example of this.

REFERENCE_STRING defaults to $VARIABLE, this means that slashes will be
converted to backslashes if $VARIABLE already contains some backslashes
(see $thirddir below).

       firstdir='/usr/local//share'
       seconddir='C:\Program Files\\'
       thirddir='C:\home/usr/'
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([firstdir])
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([seconddir])
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([thirddir])
       # $firstdir = '/usr/local/share'
       # $seconddir = 'C:\Program Files'
       # $thirddir = 'C:\home\usr'

     AX_NUMERIC_NAMEDLEVEL(VARNAME [,FROMVAR [,DEFAULT [,YESLEVEL]]])

Description
***********

The levelstring FROMVAR is expanded and checked for verbal names that
will map on to eight different levels - the VARNAME will receive this
numeric level where "all" maps to 7 (lower three bits set) higher levels
for 8 and 9 exist too. This macro is a nice helper to convert user input
of a -with-opt=level into a numeric form that can be simply pushed as a
#define like with AC_DEFINE:

      default YESLEVEL = 2 /* including unknown levelspec */
      default DEFAULT  = 0 /* when named level is empty */
      default FROMVAR  = VARNAME

The DEFAULT value is used if the NAMED levelstring has become empty and
it is copied without further conversion - a default of "0" is used if
absent - identical to "no". A "yes" will be set to the YESLEVEL - and
note that "yes" has "2" as its default value not "1". (which comes from
its original use to set a "gcc -O2").

the mnemonic names are:

        9| insane |ultrasome|experimentalplus
        8| ultra  |ultra|experimental)
        7| all    |muchmore|somemanymore|manymoreplus
        6| most   |manymore|most)
        5| strict |somemore|almost
        4| more   |more
        3| extra  |manyplus|plusmuch|somemany|plusmany
        2| many   |many|much|(yes)
        1| some   |some|plus

note that a level can be construcct of (some|plus) = bit-0, (many|much)
= bit-1, (more) = bit-2, (ultra|experimental) = bit-3 atleast in a
left-to-right order, ie. plusmanymore=7

Example usage:

        AX_NUMERIC_NAMEDLEVEL(OPTLEVEL,with_optlevel,1,3)
        AC_DEFINE(OPTLEVEL)
        test "$GCC" = "yes" && CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -O$OPTLEVEL)

     AX_OPENMP([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to find out how to compile programs that use OpenMP a
standard API and set of compiler directives for parallel programming
(see http://www-unix.mcs/)

On success, it sets the OPENMP_CFLAGS/OPENMP_CXXFLAGS/OPENMP_F77FLAGS
output variable to the flag (e.g. -omp) used both to compile *and* link
OpenMP programs in the current language.

NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
but also link it with them as well.

If you want to compile everything with OpenMP, you should set:

         CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $OPENMP_CFLAGS"
         #OR#  CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $OPENMP_CXXFLAGS"
         #OR#  FFLAGS="$FFLAGS $OPENMP_FFLAGS"

(depending on the selected language).

The user can override the default choice by setting the corresponding
environment variable (e.g. OPENMP_CFLAGS).

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if an OpenMP flag is
found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it is
not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
define HAVE_OPENMP.

**********************************

Synopsis
********

     AX_PATCH_LIBTOOL_CHANGING_CMDS_IFS

Description
***********

Do a `grep "^[a-z]*_cmds=" libtool` - these are "subroutines" encoded by
libtool.m4 into the generated libtool script. Since libtool assumes that
there is no subroutine-facility in the shell invoked, these are not
actually subroutines, but actually a "list of commands". This looks
correct, but the command separator is not ";" - it is "~", the tilde
character.

Now, grep again, look for `grep 'IFS="~"' libtool` and see that libtool
scripting uses a for-loop on the command-list, i.e for cmd in
$some_cmds. This works correctly when the IFS was modified, where IFS
stands for "input field separator" which is whitespace characters by
default.

The problem: I have some real-world filesystems where there are
directories using "~" inside of them, to be more to the point, it is a
change control management software that uses source repositories of the
form "path/master/project~version/src" and libtool has the tendency to
resolve any symlinks so that it will paste such path into the $_cmds
script when it gets evaluated a number of times.

This script is a workaround: I do not know why the ";" was not chosen as
the IFS, perhaps it has some weird interactions in some shells since it
is also the default record separator being one time bigger in context
than the argument separator. I have made good success however with using
"?" as the IFS, since there is no path-name that uses a question mark,
and there is no _cmds ever around that uses "?" for some thing.

Oh yes, there are some usages of "*" to match shell-wise at the output
file of some tool, so that might have triggered the choice to not use
"?" in the first place - but in real life it never occured that a _cmds
script was created that has gone to use "?". And so, this ac-macro
exchanges the s/~/?/g in configured _cmds variables and replaces all
occurences of s/IFS="~"/IFS="?"/ - and it all works smooth now.

Synopsis

     AX_PATH_BDB([MINIMUM-VERSION], [ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

Description
***********

This macro finds the latest version of Berkeley DB on the system, and
ensures that the header file and library versions match. If
MINIMUM-VERSION is specified, it will ensure that the library found is
at least that version.

It determines the name of the library as well as the path to the header
file and library. It will check both the default environment as well as
the default Berkeley DB install location. When found, it sets BDB_LIBS,
BDB_CPPFLAGS, and BDB_LDFLAGS to the necessary values to add to LIBS,
CPPFLAGS, and LDFLAGS, as well as setting BDB_VERSION to the version
found. HAVE_DB_H is defined also.

The option -with-bdb-dir=DIR can be used to specify a specific Berkeley
DB installation to use.

An example of it's use is:

        AX_PATH_BDB([3],[
          LIBS="$BDB_LIBS $LIBS"
          LDFLAGS="$BDB_LDFLAGS $LDFLAGS"
          CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $BDB_CPPFLAGS"
        ])

which will locate the latest version of Berkeley DB on the system, and
ensure that it is version 3.0 or higher.

Details: This macro does not use either AC_CHECK_HEADERS or AC_CHECK_LIB
because, first, the functions inside the library are sometimes renamed
to contain a version code that is only available from the db.h on the
system, and second, because it is common to have multiple db.h and libdb
files on a system it is important to make sure the ones being used
correspond to the same version. Additionally, there are many different
possible names for libdb when installed by an OS distribution, and these
need to be checked if db.h does not correspond to libdb.

When cross compiling, only header versions are verified since it would
be difficult to check the library version. Additionally the default
Berkeley DB installation locations /usr/local/BerkeleyDB* are not
searched for higher versions of the library.

The format for the list of library names to search came from the Cyrus
IMAP distribution, although they are generated dynamically here, and
only for the version found in db.h.

The macro AX_COMPARE_VERSION is required to use this macro, and should
be available from the Autoconf Macro Archive.

The author would like to acknowledge the generous and valuable feedback
from Guido Draheim, without which this macro would be far less robust,
and have poor and inconsistent cross compilation support.

Changes:

      1/5/05 applied patch from Rafa Rzepecki to eliminate compiler
             warning about unused variable, argv

     AX_PATH_GENERIC(LIBRARY,[MINIMUM-VERSION,[SED-EXPR-EXTRACTOR]],[ACTION-IF-FOUND],[ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND],[CONFIG-SCRIPTS],[CFLAGS-ARG],[LIBS-ARG])

Description
***********

Runs the LIBRARY-config script and defines LIBRARY_CFLAGS and
LIBRARY_LIBS

The script must support `-cflags' and `-libs' args. If MINIMUM-VERSION
is specified, the script must also support the `-version' arg. If the
`-with-library-[exec-]prefix' arguments to ./configure are given, it
must also support `-prefix' and `-exec-prefix'. Prefereable use
CONFIG-SCRIPTS as config script, CFLAGS-ARG instead of `-cflags` and
LIBS-ARG instead of `-libs`, if given.

The SED-EXPR-EXTRACTOR parameter representes the expression used in sed
to extract the version number. Use it if your 'foo-config -version'
dumps something like 'Foo library v1.0.0 (alfa)' instead of '1.0.0'.

Example:

        AX_PATH_GENERIC(Foo, 1.0.0)

would run `foo-config -version' and check that it is at least 1.0.0, if
successful the following variables would be defined and substituted:

        FOO_CFLAGS to `foo-config --cflags`
        FOO_LIBS   to `foo-config --libs`

Example:

        AX_PATH_GENERIC([Bar],,,[
           AC_MSG_ERROR([Cannot find Bar library])
        ])

would check for bar-config program, defining and substituting the
following variables:

        BAR_CFLAGS to `bar-config --cflags`
        BAR_LIBS   to `bar-config --libs`

This macro is a rearranged version of AC_PATH_GENERIC from Angus Lees.

ax_path_milter
**************

Synopsis
********

     AX_PATH_MILTER([MINIMUM-VERSION, [ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to automatically find the library libmilter.a and the
header file "libmilter/mfapi.h", which are required when compiling a
milter for Sendmail. When successful, it sets the output variable
MILTER_LIBS to "-lmilter", MILTER_LDFLAGS to contain an -Lpathtolib
option, and MILTER_CPPFLAGS to contain an -Ipathtoinclude option, if
they are necessary.

The easiest way to use this macro is something like:

       AX_PATH_MILTER([8.12],[
         LIBS="$MILTER_LIBS $LIBS"
         LDFLAGS="$MILTER_LDFLAGS $LDFLAGS"
         CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $MILTER_CPPFLAGS"
       ],[
         AC_MSG_ERROR([required milter library and header not found])
       ])

If the macro is successful, it just adds any flags to the necessary
environment. If it is not successful, it would likely be a fatal error,
because if an application is linking with libmilter.a, it is probably
because it is a milter.

There are two optional "-with" options for configure which are added.
If they are specified, they override any searching that is done. They
are:

       --with-sendmail-base=<DIR>  This option is used to explicitly
              specify the base of the sendmail distribution.

       --with-sendmail-obj=<DIR>   The option is used to explicitly specify
              the "obj.*" subdirectory in the sendmail distribution
              that should be used.

When sendmail-base is not specified, the current environment is first
tested to see if the header and library are available, and if so
MILTER_LDFLAGS and MILTER_CPPFLAGS are left empty.

There are two places that are searched for the sendmail base directory.
The first location is one directory down from the current directory. It
checks if there is a directory of the form sendmail-8.1*, limited to
version 8.12.x or higher, then chooses the directory with the highest
version number. If that method does not succeed, it then looks in the
file /etc/mail/sendmail.cf for the directory it was built from, and uses
the base of that distribution. If neither of these methods work, then it
fails.

There are two methods for finding the "obj.*" directory when it is not
specified. The first is to try to run sendmail's Build program with the
-M option which will print out the name of the obj. directory for the
tool in the directory where it is run from. If this does not work, is
looks for the newest directory of the form "obj.*" in the sendmail base
directory.

Two addition output variables that are defined, whether or not the files
are found are SENDMAIL_BASE_DIR and SENDMAIL_OBJ_DIR, which are the
suspected location of the sendmail base directory and obj.*
subdirectory.

NOTE: POSIX threads MUST be configured BEFORE this function is called or
it will not find libmilter.a even if it exists. The easiest way is to
use the AX_PTHREAD macro by Steven G. Johnson and Alejandro Forero
Cuervo which is available from the Autoconf Macro Archive.

******************

Synopsis

     AX_PGSQL_PRIV_ROOT(DB, USER, [HOST], [PASSWORD], [ACTION_IF_FAILED], [ACTION_IF_OK])

Description
***********

This macro checks wether the given PostgreSQL user has root privileges
(can create and drop databases) It is recommended to first call
AX_CHECK_PGSQL_DB, this makes it easier to locate the cause of error.
The macro AX_PROG_PGCLIENT is required by this one.

The variable $pgclient_root_call is set for later use in Makefiles, if
you'd like to make use of this, you must do

         AC_SUBST(pgclient_root_call)

after having called AX_CHECK_PGSQL_PRIV_ROOT. You can then do something
like the following in your Makefile.am:

         @pgclient_root_call@ -f file.sql

If you want the user to set the data, you should support something like
these configure options:

         AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-host,
                 [  --with-pgsql-host=HOST               server is running on HOST @<:@local socket@:>@],
                 [pg_host=$withval], [pg_host=])

         AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-db,
                 [  --with-pgsql-db=DBNAME               use database DBNAME @<:@test@:>@],
                 [pg_db=$withval], [pg_db=test])

         AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-root-user,
                 [  --with-pgsql-root-user=USER          use user USER, must have root (all) privileges @<:@postgres@:>@],
                 [pg_root_user=$withval], [pg_root_user=postgres])

         AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-password,
                 [  --with-pgsql-password=PASSWORD       use password PASSWORD @<:@none@:>@],
                 [pg_password=$withval], [pg_password=""])

You can then call the macro like this:

         AX_CHECK_PGSQL_PRIV_ROOT([$pg_db], [$pg_root_user], [$pg_host], [$pg_password], [AC_MSG_ERROR([We need root privileges on database!])])

ax_pkg_mico
***********

Synopsis
********

     AX_PKG_MICO([X.X.X optional required])

Description
***********

This macro searches for a MICO installation on your system. MICO (Mico
Is COrba) installs the file 'mico-setup.sh' under MICO_INSTALL_BASE/lib,
where MICO_INSTALL_BASE is probably /usr/local or /usr. If nothing was
specified when calling configure or just -with-mico, it searches in
$prefix/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib The argument of s-with-mico
specifies the full pathname of the mico-setup.sh file. For instance
-with-mico=/usr/local/mico-2.2.6/lib/mico-setup.sh.

If the version argument is given (e.g. 2.2.6), AX_PKG_MICO checks that
the mico package is this version number or higher.

The other optional argument to AX_PKG_MICO are 'optional' and
'required'. by default, placing AX_PKG_MICO in your configure.in does
not enforce using mico, if it is not found on the system. If MICO
existence is critical for the building of your package, then you
probably want to specify something like "AX_PKG_MICO(2.2.6 required)".
Then, even if the -with-mico was not spcefied on the command line of
the configure script, an error will be raised if mico was not found.

If the mico package is not found, abort configuration with error
message.

It defines the symbol MICOSETUP, MICOVERSION, MICOSHAREDDIR
MICO_INCLUDE, MICO_LIB and MICO_CXX if mico is found. In addition, the
mico script mico-c++ (set in (MICO_CXX) is scaned for a string match
"-I.*ministl" and if foundMICO_USE_MINISTL is set to 1, otherwise to 0.

Example of use of these variables in your Makefile.in:

       INCLUDES += @MICO_INCLUDE@
       LDFLAGS += @MICO_LIB@

ax_pkg_swig
***********

Synopsis
********

     AX_PKG_SWIG([major.minor.micro], [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])

Description
***********

This macro searches for a SWIG installation on your system. If found,
then SWIG is AC_SUBST'd; if not found, then $SWIG is empty.  If SWIG is
found, then SWIG_LIB is set to the SWIG library path, and AC_SUBST'd.

You can use the optional first argument to check if the version of the
available SWIG is greater than or equal to the value of the argument. It
should have the format: N[.N[.N]] (N is a number between 0 and 999. Only
the first N is mandatory.) If the version argument is given (e.g.
1.3.17), AX_PKG_SWIG checks that the swig package is this version number
or higher.

As usual, action-if-found is executed if SWIG is found, otherwise
action-if-not-found is executed.

In configure.in, use as:

       AX_PKG_SWIG(1.3.17, [], [ AC_MSG_ERROR([SWIG is required to build..]) ])
       AX_SWIG_ENABLE_CXX
       AX_SWIG_MULTI_MODULE_SUPPORT

ax_prefix_config_h
******************

Synopsis
********

     AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H [(OUTPUT-HEADER [,PREFIX [,ORIG-HEADER]])]

Description
***********

This is a new variant from ac_prefix_config_ this one will use a
lowercase-prefix if the config-define was starting with a
lowercase-char, e.g. "#define const", "#define restrict", or "#define
off_t", (and this one can live in another directory, e.g.
testpkg/config.h therefore I decided to move the output-header to be the
first arg)

takes the usual config.h generated header file; looks for each of the
generated "#define SOMEDEF" lines, and prefixes the defined name (ie.
makes it "#define PREFIX_SOMEDEF". The result is written to the output
config.header file. The PREFIX is converted to uppercase for the
conversions.

Defaults:

       OUTPUT-HEADER = $PACKAGE-config.h
       PREFIX = $PACKAGE
       ORIG-HEADER, from AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)

Your configure.ac script should contain both macros in this order, and
unlike the earlier variations of this prefix-macro it is okay to place
the AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H call before the AC_OUTPUT invokation.

Example:

       AC_INIT(config.h.in)        # config.h.in as created by "autoheader"
       AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(testpkg, 0.1.1)    # makes #undef VERSION and PACKAGE
       AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)          # prep config.h from config.h.in
       AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H(mylib/_config.h) # prep mylib/_config.h from it..
       AC_MEMORY_H                         # makes "#undef NEED_MEMORY_H"
       AC_C_CONST_H                        # makes "#undef const"
       AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)                 # creates the "config.h" now
                                           # and also mylib/_config.h

if the argument to AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H would have been omitted then the
default outputfile would have been called simply "testpkg-config.h", but
even under the name "mylib/_config.h" it contains prefix-defines like

       #ifndef TESTPKG_VERSION
       #define TESTPKG_VERSION "0.1.1"
       #endif
       #ifndef TESTPKG_NEED_MEMORY_H
       #define TESTPKG_NEED_MEMORY_H 1
       #endif
       #ifndef _testpkg_const
       #define _testpkg_const _const
       #endif

and this "mylib/_config.h" can be installed along with other
header-files, which is most convenient when creating a shared library
(that has some headers) where some functionality is dependent on the
OS-features detected at compile-time. No need to invent some
"mylib-confdefs.h.in" manually. :-)

Note that some AC_DEFINEs that end up in the config.h file are actually
self-referential - e.g. AC_C_INLINE, AC_C_CONST, and the AC_TYPE_OFF_T
say that they "will define inline|const|off_t if the system does not do
it by itself". You might want to clean up about these - consider an
extra mylib/conf.h that reads something like:

        #include <mylib/_config.h>
        #ifndef _testpkg_const
        #define _testpkg_const const
        #endif

and then start using _testpkg_const in the header files. That is also a
good thing to differentiate whether some library-user has starting to
take up with a different compiler, so perhaps it could read something
like this:

       #ifdef _MSC_VER
       #include <mylib/_msvc.h>
       #else
       #include <mylib/_config.h>
       #endif
       #ifndef _testpkg_const
       #define _testpkg_const const
       #endif

ax_prog_apache
**************

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROG_APACHE([version])

Description
***********

This macro searches for an installed apache server. If nothing was
specified when calling configure or just -with-apache, it searches in
/usr/local/apache/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
The argument of -with-apache specifies the full pathname of the httpd
argument. For instance -with-apache=/usr/sbin/httpd.

If the version argument is given, AX_PROG_APACHE checks that the apache
server is this version number or higher.

If the apache server is not found, abort configuration with error
message.

It defines the symbol APACHE if the server is found.

Files using apache should do the following:

       @APACHE@ -d /etc/httpd

It defines the symbol APACHE_MODULES if a directory containing mod_env.*
is found in the default server root directory (obtained with httpd -V).

The httpd.conf file listing modules to be loaded dynamicaly can use
@APACHE_MODULES@ to grab them in the appropriate sub directory. For
instance:

      ...
      <IfModule mod_so.c>
      LoadModule env_module         @APACHE_MODULES@/mod_env.so
      LoadModule config_log_module  @APACHE_MODULES@/mod_log_config.so
      ...

ax_prog_cc_for_build
********************

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD

Description
***********

This macro searches for a C compiler that generates native executables,
that is a C compiler that surely is not a cross-compiler. This can be
useful if you have to generate source code at compile-time like for
example GCC does.

The macro sets the CC_FOR_BUILD and CPP_FOR_BUILD macros to anything
needed to compile or link (CC_FOR_BUILD) and preprocess (CPP_FOR_BUILD).
The value of these variables can be overridden by the user by specifying
a compiler with an environment variable (like you do for standard CC).

It also sets BUILD_EXEEXT and BUILD_OBJEXT to the executable and object
file extensions for the build platform, and GCC_FOR_BUILD to `yes' if
the compiler we found is GCC. All these variables but GCC_FOR_BUILD are
substituted in the Makefile.

************

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROG_CP_S

Description
***********

Check how to make a copy by creating a symbolic link to the original -
it defines the variable CP_S for further use, which you should in fact
treat like it used to be with be LN_S. The actual value is assured to be
either LN_S (if the filesystem supports symbolic links) or CP (if the
filesystem does not know about symbolic links and you need a copy of
original file to have the same text in both places). In a gnu
environment it will simply set CP_S="cp -s" since the gnu "cp"-command
has the "-s" flag. You shall not try to use this command on directories
since it would require a "-r" in the case of a copy that is not
supported explicitly here. (I'm not sure if some "cp"-commands out there
would barf at usage of "-r" on a normal file).

Use CP_S to create a copy of read-only data - if your filesystem
supports it then a symbolic link is created - a process that is quicker
and space-saving. However, if the target fs does not support symbolic
links, just copy the data. Unlike ac_prog_ln_s this macro will never
fail to set the CP_S ac_subst to something that works.

     DX_PDF_FEATURE(ON|OFF)
     DX_PS_FEATURE(ON|OFF)

Description
***********

The DX_*_FEATURE macros control the default setting for the given
Doxygen feature. Supported features are 'DOXYGEN' itself, 'DOT' for
generating graphics, 'HTML' for plain HTML, 'CHM' for compressed HTML
help (for MS users), 'CHI' for generating a seperate .chi file by the
.chm file, and 'MAN', 'RTF', 'XML', 'PDF' and 'PS' for the appropriate
output formats. The environment variable DOXYGEN_PAPER_SIZE may be
specified to override the default 'a4wide' paper size.

By default, HTML, PDF and PS documentation is generated as this seems to
be the most popular and portable combination. MAN pages created by
Doxygen are usually problematic, though by picking an appropriate subset
and doing some massaging they might be better than nothing. CHM and RTF
are specific for MS (note that you can't generate both HTML and CHM at
the same time). The XML is rather useless unless you apply specialized
post-processing to it.

The macros mainly control the default state of the feature. The use can
override the default by specifying -enable or -disable. The macros
ensure that contradictory flags are not given (e.g.,
-enable-doxygen-html and -enable-doxygen-chm, -enable-doxygen-anything
with -disable-doxygen, etc.) Finally, each feature will be
automatically disabled (with a warning) if the required programs are
missing.

Once all the feature defaults have been specified, call DX_INIT_DOXYGEN
with the following parameters: a one-word name for the project for use
as a filename base etc., an optional configuration file name (the
default is 'Doxyfile', the same as Doxygen's default), and an optional
output directory name (the default is 'doxygen-doc').

Automake Support

The following is a template aminclude.am file for use with Automake.
Make targets and variables values are controlled by the various
DX_COND_* conditionals set by autoconf.

The provided targets are:

       doxygen-doc: Generate all doxygen documentation.

       doxygen-run: Run doxygen, which will generate some of the
                    documentation (HTML, CHM, CHI, MAN, RTF, XML)
                    but will not do the post processing required
                    for the rest of it (PS, PDF, and some MAN).

       doxygen-man: Rename some doxygen generated man pages.

       doxygen-ps:  Generate doxygen PostScript documentation.

       doxygen-pdf: Generate doxygen PDF documentation.

Note that by default these are not integrated into the automake targets.
If doxygen is used to generate man pages, you can achieve this
integration by setting man3_MANS to the list of man pages generated and
then adding the dependency:

       $(man3_MANS): doxygen-doc

This will cause make to run doxygen and generate all the documentation.

The following variable is intended for use in Makefile.am:

       DX_CLEANFILES = everything to clean.

Then add this variable to MOSTLYCLEANFILES.

     AX_PROG_GUILE_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])

Description
***********

Makes sure that guile supports the version indicated. If true the shell
commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell commands in
ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $GUILE is not set (for example by
running AC_CHECK_PROG or AC_PATH_PROG) the macro will fail.

Example:

       AC_PATH_PROG([GUILE],[guile])
       AC_PROG_GUILE_VERSION([1.6.0],[ ... ],[ ... ])

This will check to make sure that the guile you have supports at least
version 1.6.0.

NOTE: This macro uses the $GUILE variable to perform the check.
AX_WITH_GUILE can be used to set that variable prior to running this
macro. The $GUILE_VERSION variable will be valorized with the detected
version.

     AX_PROG_JAR

Description
***********

AX_PROG_JAR tests for an existing jar program. It uses the environment
variable JAR then tests in sequence various common jar programs.

If you want to force a specific compiler:

- at the configure.in level, set JAR=yourcompiler before calling
AX_PROG_JAR

- at the configure level, setenv JAR

You can use the JAR variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAR@.

Note: This macro depends on the autoconf M4 macros for Java programs. It
is VERY IMPORTANT that you download that whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission.

The general documentation of those macros, as well as the sample
configure.in, is included in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.

     AX_PROG_JAVA

Description
***********

Here is a summary of the main macros:

AX_PROG_JAVAC: finds a Java compiler.

AX_PROG_JAVA: finds a Java virtual machine.

AX_CHECK_CLASS: finds if we have the given class (beware of CLASSPATH!).

AX_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS: finds if we have the given class and stops
otherwise.

AX_TRY_COMPILE_JAVA: attempt to compile user given source.

AC_TRY_RUN_JAVA: attempt to compile and run user given source.

AC_JAVA_OPTIONS: adds Java configure options.

AX_PROG_JAVA tests an existing Java virtual machine. It uses the
environment variable JAVA then tests in sequence various common Java
virtual machines. For political reasons, it starts with the free ones.
You *must* call [AX_PROG_JAVAC] before.

If you want to force a specific VM:

- at the configure.in level, set JAVA=yourvm before calling AX_PROG_JAVA

       (but after AC_INIT)

- at the configure level, setenv JAVA

You can use the JAVA variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAVA@.

*Warning*: its success or failure can depend on a proper setting of the
CLASSPATH env. variable.

TODO: allow to exclude virtual machines (rationale: most Java programs
cannot run with some VM like kaffe).

Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission.

***************

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROG_JAVA_CC

Description
***********

Finds the appropriate java compiler on your path. By preference the java
compiler is gcj, then jikes then javac.

The macro can take one argument specifying a space separated list of
java compiler names.

For example:

       AX_PROG_JAVA_CC(javac, gcj)

The macro also sets the compiler options variable: JAVA_CC_OPTS to
something sensible:

      - for GCJ it sets it to: @GCJ_OPTS@
        (if GCJ_OPTS is not yet defined then it is set to "-C")

      - no other compiler has applicable options yet

Here's an example configure.in:

       AC_INIT(Makefile.in)
       AX_PROG_JAVA_CC()
       AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)
       dnl End.

And here's the start of the Makefile.in:

       PROJECT_ROOT      := @srcdir@
       # Tool definitions.
       JAVAC             := @JAVA_CC@
       JAVAC_OPTS        := @JAVA_CC_OPTS@
       JAR_TOOL          := @jar_tool@

and a 'SELECT * FROM user' SQL statement. That SQL statement will select
all user information from the 'user' privileges table, and should work
on every proper MySQL server.

Besides checking mysql, this macro also set these environment variables
upon completion:
