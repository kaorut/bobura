     AX_PROG_PERL_MODULES([MODULES], [ACTION-IF-TRUE], [ACTION-IF-FALSE])

Description
***********

Checks to see if the given perl modules are available. If true the shell
commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell commands in
ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $PERL is not set (for example by
calling AC_CHECK_PROG, or AC_PATH_PROG), AC_CHECK_PROG(PERL, perl, perl)
will be run.

MODULES is a space separated list of module names. To check for a
minimum version of a module, append the version number to the module
name, separated by an equals sign.

Example:

       AX_PROG_PERL_MODULES( Text::Wrap Net::LDAP=1.0.3, ,
                             AC_MSG_WARN(Need some Perl modules)

     AX_PROG_PERL_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])

Description
***********

Makes sure that perl supports the version indicated. If true the shell
commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell commands in
ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $PERL is not set (for example by
running AC_CHECK_PROG or AC_PATH_PROG) the macro will fail.

       AX_PROG_PERL_VERSION([5.8.0],[ ... ],[ ... ])

This will check to make sure that the perl you have supports at least
version 5.8.0.

NOTE: This macro uses the $PERL variable to perform the check.
AX_WITH_PERL can be used to set that variable prior to running this
macro. The $PERL_VERSION variable will be valorized with the detected
version.

     AX_PROG_PGCLIENT()

Description
***********

This macro searches for a program called 'pgclient'. If found the
variable $pgclient is set to its path. Else it is set to 0. An option is
added to the configure script for setting an search path instead of
$PATH ($pgclient_dir). If pgclient is necessary for installing your
program, you can do something like the following to stop configure with
an error if pgclient wasn't found:

           if test "x$pgclient" = "x0"; then AC_MSG_ERROR([We need that to setup the database!]); fi

      AX_PROG_TCL

This checks for tcl and if not found, exits with an error. If found, it
prints tcl path and version number.

      AX_PROG_TCL([8.0])

Checks for tcl and exits with an error if its not found or the version
is below 8.0.

************

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROTOTYPE(function, includes, code, TAG1, values1 [, TAG2, values2 [...]])

Description
***********

Try all the combinations of <TAG1>, <TAG2>... to successfully compile
<code>. <TAG1>, <TAG2>, ... are substituted in <code> and <include> with
values found in <values1>, <values2>, ... respectively. <values1>,
<values2>, ... contain a list of possible values for each corresponding
tag and all combinations are tested. When AC_TRY_COMPILE(include, code)
is successfull for a given substitution, the macro stops and defines the
following macros: FUNCTION_TAG1, FUNCTION_TAG2, ... using AC_DEFINE()
with values set to the current values of <TAG1>, <TAG2>, ... If no
combination is successfull the configure script is aborted with a
message.

Intended purpose is to find which combination of argument types is
acceptable for a given function <function>. It is recommended to list
the most specific types first. For instance ARG1, [size_t, int] instead
of ARG1, [int, size_t].

Generic usage pattern:

1) add a call in configure.in

      AX_PROTOTYPE(...)

2) call autoheader to see which symbols are not covered

3) add the lines in acconfig.h

      /* Type of Nth argument of function */
      #undef FUNCTION_ARGN

4) Within the code use FUNCTION_ARGN instead of an hardwired type

Complete example:

1) configure.in

      AX_PROTOTYPE(getpeername,
      [
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>
      ],
      [
       int a = 0;
       ARG2 * b = 0;
       ARG3 * c = 0;
       getpeername(a, b, c);
      ],
      ARG2, [struct sockaddr, void],
      ARG3, [socklen_t, size_t, int, unsigned int, long unsigned int])

2) call autoheader

      autoheader: Symbol `GETPEERNAME_ARG2' is not covered by ./acconfig.h
      autoheader: Symbol `GETPEERNAME_ARG3' is not covered by ./acconfig.h

3) acconfig.h

      /* Type of second argument of getpeername */
      #undef GETPEERNAME_ARG2

      /* Type of third argument of getpeername */
      #undef GETPEERNAME_ARG3

4) in the code

          ...
          GETPEERNAME_ARG2 name;
          GETPEERNAME_ARG3 namelen;
          ...
          ret = getpeername(socket, &name, &namelen);
          ...

Implementation notes: generating all possible permutations of the
arguments is not easily done with the usual mixture of shell and m4,
that is why this macro is almost 100% m4 code. It generates long but
simple to read code.

Synopsis

     AX_PTHREAD([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX threads. It
sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and linker
flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special C compiler
flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain compiler
flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment variables.)

Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise). (This
is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)

NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link with
$PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS

If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use these
variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:

            LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
            CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
            CC="$PTHREAD_CC"

In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute constant
has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to that name
(e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads library
is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
will define HAVE_PTHREAD.

Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or if
you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based on work
by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/) (with help
from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread macros posted by
Alejandro Forero Cuervo to the autoconf macro repository. We are also
grateful for the helpful feedback of numerous users.

     AX_PYTHON

Description
***********

This macro does a complete Python development environment check.

It recurses through several python versions (from 2.1 to 2.6 in this
version), looking for an executable. When it finds an executable, it
looks to find the header files and library.

It sets PYTHON_BIN to the name of the python executable,
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory holding the header files, and
PYTHON_LIB to the name of the Python library.

This macro calls AC_SUBST on PYTHON_BIN (via AC_CHECK_PROG),
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIB.

     AX_PYTHON_CONFIG_VAR(PYTHON_VARIABLE, [SHELL_VARIABLE])
     AX_PYTHON_CONFIG_H
     AX_PYTHON_MAKEFILE

Description
***********

AX_PYTHON_CONFIG_VAR:

Using the Python module distutils.sysconfig[1], return a Python
configuration variable. PYTHON_VARIABLE is the name of the variable to
request from Python, and SHELL_VARIABLE is the name of the shell
variable into which the results should be deposited. If SHELL_VARIABLE
is not specified, the macro wil prefix PY_ to the PYTHON_VARIABLE, e.g.,
LIBS -> PY_LIBS.

SHELL_VARIABLE is AC_SUBST'd. No action is taken if an error occurs.
Note if $PYTHON is not set, AC_CHECK_PROG(PYTHON, python, python) will
be run.

Example:

       AX_PYTHON_CONFIG_VAR(LINKFORSHARED, PY_LFS)

AX_PYTHON_CONFIG_H:

Using the Python module distutils.sysconfig[1], put the full pathname of
the config.h file used to compile Python into the shell variable
PY_CONFIG_H. PY_CONFIG_H is AC_SUBST'd. Note if $PYTHON is not set,
AC_CHECK_PROG(PYTHON, python, python) will be run.

AX_PYTHON_MAKEFILE:

Using the Python module distutils.sysconfig[1], put the full pathname of
the Makefile file used to compile Python into the shell variable
PY_MAKEFILE. PY_MAKEFILE is AC_SUBST'd. Note if $PYTHON is not set,
AC_CHECK_PROG(PYTHON, python, python) will be run.

Synopsis

     AX_PYTHON_DEVEL([version])

Description
***********

Note: Defines as a precious variable "PYTHON_VERSION". Don't override it
in your configure.ac.

This macro checks for Python and tries to get the include path to
'Python.h'. It provides the $(PYTHON_CPPFLAGS) and $(PYTHON_LDFLAGS)
output variables. It also exports $(PYTHON_EXTRA_LIBS) and
$(PYTHON_EXTRA_LDFLAGS) for embedding Python in your code.

You can search for some particular version of Python by passing a
parameter to this macro, for example ">= '2.3.1'", or "== '2.4'". Please
note that you *have* to pass also an operator along with the version to
match, and pay special attention to the single quotes surrounding the
version number. Don't use "PYTHON_VERSION" for this: that environment
variable is declared as precious and thus reserved for the end-user.

This macro should work for all versions of Python >= 2.1.0. As an end
user, you can disable the check for the python version by setting the
PYTHON_NOVERSIONCHECK environment variable to something else than the
empty string.

If you need to use this macro for an older Python version, please
contact the authors. We're always open for feedback.

     AX_PYTHON_WITH

     AX_PYTHON_LSPEC

Description
***********

This file provides autoconf support for those applications that want to
embed python. It supports all pythons >= 2.2 which is the first official
release containing distutils. Version 2.2 of python was released
December 21, 2001. Since it actually executes the python, cross platform
configuration will probably not work. Also, most of the platforms
supported are consistent until you look into Mac OS X. The python
included with it is installed as a framework which is a very different
environment to set up the normal tools such as gcc and libtool to deal
with. Therefore, once we establish which python that we are going to
use, we use its distutils to actually compile and link our modules or
applications.

At this time, it does NOT support linking with Python statically. It
does support dynamic linking.

This set of macros help define $PYTHON, $PYTHON_USE, $PYTHON_CSPEC and
$PYTHON_LSPEC. $PYTHON defines the full executable path for the Python
being linked to and is used within these macros to determine if that has
been specified or found. These macros do execute this python version so
it must be present on the system at configure time.

$PYTHON_USE is an automake variable that defines whether Python support
should be included or not in your application. $PYTHON_CSPEC is a
variable that supplies additional CFLAGS for the compilation of the
application/shared library. $PYTHON_LSPEC is a variable that supplies
additional LDFLAGS for linking the application/shared library.

The following is an example of how to set up for python usage within
your application in your configure.in:

       AX_PYTHON_DEFAULT( )
       AX_PYTHON_ENABLE( )             # Optional
       AX_PYTHON_WITH( )               # Optional
       AX_PYTHON_PATH( )               # or AX_PYTHON_INSIST( )
       # if $PYTHON is not defined, then the following do nothing.
       AX_PYTHON_VERSION_ENSURE( [2.2] )
       AX_PYTHON_CSPEC
       AX_PYTHON_LSPEC

The AX_PYTHON_DEFAULT sets the $PYTHON_USE to false. Thereby, excluding
it if it was optional.

The AX_PYTHON_ENABLE looks for the optional configure parameters of
-enable-python/-disable-python and establishes the $PYTHON and
$PYTHON_USE variables accordingly.

The AX_PYTHON_WITH looks for the optional configure parameters of
-with-python/-without-python and establishes the $PYTHON and
$PYTHON_USE variables accordingly.

The AX_PYTHON_PATH looks for python assuming that none has been
previously found or defined and issues an error if it does not find it.
If it does find it, it establishes the $PYTHON and $PYTHON_USE variables
accordingly. AX_PYTHON_INSIST could be used here instead if you want to
insist that Python support be included using the -enable-python or
-with-python checks previously done.

The AX_PYTHON_VERSION_ENSURE issues an error if the Python previously
found is not of version 2.2 or greater.

Once that these macros have be run, we can use PYTHON_USE within the
makefile.am file to conditionally add the Python support such as:

Makefile.am example showing optional inclusion of directories:

      if PYTHON_USE
      plugins = plugins
      src = src
      else
      plugins =
      src =
      endif

      SUBDIRS = . $(plugins) $(src)

Makefile.am example showing optional shared library build:

      if PYTHON_USE
      lib_LTLIBRARIES        = libElemList.la
      libElemList_la_SOURCES = libElemList.c
      libElemList_la_CFLAGS  = @PYTHON_CSPEC@
      libElemList_la_LDFLAGS = @PYTHON_LSPEC@
      endif

Makefile.am example showing optional program build:

      if PYTHON_USE
      bin_PROGRAMS    = runFunc
      runFunc_SOURCES = runFunc.c
      runFunc_CFLAGS  = @PYTHON_CSPEC@
      runFunc_LDFLAGS = @PYTHON_LSPEC@
      endif

The above compiles the modules only if PYTHON_USE was specified as true.
Also, the else portion of the if was optional.

     AX_REQUIRE_ONE_FUNC (FUNCTION..., [ACTION-IF-ANY-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NONE-FOUND])

Description
***********

AX_REQUIRE_ONE_FUNC is a simple wrapper for AC_CHECK_FUNCS. It calls
AC_CHECK_FUNCS on the list of functions named in the first argument,
then invokes ACTION-IF-ANY-FOUND if at least one of the functions exists
or ACTION-IF-NONE-FOUND if none of the functions exist.

Here's an example:

         AX_REQUIRE_ONE_FUNC([posix_memalign memalign valloc], ,
           [AC_MSG_ERROR([unable to allocate page-aligned memory])])

ax_rpm_init
***********

Synopsis
********

     AX_RPM_INIT

Description
***********

Setup variables for creation of rpms. It will define several variables
useful for creating rpms on a system where rpms are supported.
Currently, I requires changes to Makefile.am to function properly (see
the example below).

Also note that I do not use any non-UNIX OSs (and for the most part, I
only use RedHat), so this is probably generally not useful for other
systems.

Required setup:

In configure.in:

       dnl For my rpm.m4 macros
       RPM_RELEASE=1
       AC_SUBST(RPM_RELEASE)

       AX_RPM_INIT
       dnl Enable or disable the rpm making rules in Makefile.am
       AM_CONDITIONAL(MAKE_RPMS, test x$make_rpms = xtrue)

Furthermore, the %GNUconfigure rpm macro has a problem in that it does
not define CXXFLAGS for the target system correctly, so for compiling
C++ code, add the following line _before_ calling AC_PROG_CXX:

       dnl This is a little hack to make this work with rpm better (see mysql++.spec.in)
       test -z "$CXXFLAGS" && CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

Changes to Makefile.am (I am trying to get rid of this step; suggestions
invited):

       if MAKE_RPMS
       rpm: @RPM_TARGET@

       .PHONY: rpm

       $(RPM_TARGET): $(DISTFILES)
         ${MAKE} dist
         -mkdir -p $(RPM_DIR)/SRPMS
         -mkdir -p `dirname $(RPM_TARGET)`
         $(RPM_PROG) $(RPM_ARGS) $(RPM_TARBALL)
         @echo Congratulations, $(RPM_TARGET) "(and friends)" should now exist.
       else
       endif

Also, it works best with a XXXX.spec.in file like the following (this is
way down on the wishlist, but a program to generate the skeleton spec.in
much like autoscan would just kick butt!):

a bit different, even on FHS2-compliant systems where the mandir is
going to $prefix/man only if prefix=/usr, otherwise they shall go to
$datadir/man. We use an extra docprefix to express it which is either
defined as being prefix or datadir. not SUBSTed here.

set PACKAGE from the given specfile - default to basename of the
rpmspecfile if no "name:" could be found in the spec file.

set VERSION from the given specfile - default to a date-derived value if
no "version:" could be found in the spec file.

this macro builds on top of AX_SPEC_FILE / AX_SPEC_EXTRACT

more specific: if not "name:" or "%define name" was found in the
myproject.spec file then the PACKAGE var is set to the basename
"myproject". When no spec file was present then it will usually default
to "TODO".

The version spec looks for "version:" or "%define version" in the spec
file. When no such value was seen or no spec file had been present then
the value is set to `date +0.%y.%W%w`.

the version value itself is sanitized somewhat with making it to always
carry atleast three digits (1.2.3) and clensing superflous "0" chars
around from generating numbers elsewhere.

additional macros are provided that extract a specific value from the
spec file, among these:

set PACKAGE_SUMMARY from the given specfile - default to package and try
to detect a type suffix if "summary:" was not in the spec file

set PACKAGE_LICENSE from the given specfile - if no "license:" tag was
given in the spec file then various COPYING files are grepped to have a
guess and the final fallback will be GNU GPL (or GNU LGPL).

set PACKAGE_ICON from the given specfile - if no "icon:" tag was given
in the spec file then we default to $PACKAGE-icon.png

the final AX_SPEC_INIT(specfile) will initialize all variables to its
defaults according to the spec file given.

     AX_STRING_STRCASECMP

Description
***********

This macro tries to find strcasecmp() in string.h.

Use this macro in conjunction with AX_STRINGS_STRCASECMP in your
configure.in like so:

         AX_STRING_STRCASECMP
         if test x"$ac_cv_string_strcasecmp" = "xno" ; then
             AX_STRINGS_STRCASECMP
         fi

This will cause either HAVE_STRING_STRCASECMP or HAVE_STRINGS_STRCASECMP
to be defined in config.h, which will tell your code what header to
include to get strcasecmp()'s prototype.

possibility; if HAVE_STRUCT_SEMUM isn't defined for a given system, you
have to define this structure before you can call functions like
semctl().

You should call AX_SYSV_IPC before this macro, to separate the check for
System V IPC headers from the check for struct semun.

ax_subst_with
*************

Synopsis
********

     AX_SUBST_WITH([varname])

Description
***********

a very simple macro but also very helpful - the varname is usually the
one from an AC_ARG_ENABLE or AC_ARG_WITH option. it is transliterated
into uppercase and a prefix WITH_ and WITHOUT_ that are both _SUBSTed.

Only one of these is set to "#" while the other is empty. In other words
a call like AC_WITHNONE(enable-call) will create two SUBST-symbols as
WITH_ENABLE_CALL and WITHOUT_ENABLE_CALL. When the varname had been set
to something not "no" or "0" or ":" or "false" then it results in

      WITH_ENABLE_CALL="" ; WITHOUT_ENABLE_CALL="#"

which you can use in your Makefile quite easily as if using an
AM_CONDITIONAL but which can be also parsed by normal make

USE = @WITH_ENABLE_CALL@ -Denabled USE = @WITHOUT_ENABLE_CALL@
-Dnot_enabled

**************************

Synopsis

     AX_SYS_LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE

Description
***********

Check whether the current system is sensitive to -Ddefines making off_t
having different types/sizes. Automatically define a config.h symbol
LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE if that is the case, otherwise leave everything as
is.

This macro builds on top of AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to detect whether special
options are neede to make the code use 64bit off_t - in many setups this
will also make the code use 64bit off_t immediatly.

The common use of a LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE config.h-define is to rename
exported functions, usually adding a 64 to the original function name.
Such renamings are only needed on systems being both (a) 32bit off_t by
default and (b) implementing large.file extensions (as for unix98).

a renaming section could look like this:

      #if defined LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE && _FILE_OFFSET_BITS+0 == 64
      #define zzip_open zzip_open64
      #define zzip_seek zzip_seek64
      #endif

for libraries, it is best to take advantage of the prefix-config.h
macro, otherwise you want to export a renamed LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE in an
installed header file. -> see AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H

********************

Synopsis
********

     AX_SYS_PERLSHARPBANG

Description
***********

Determine how the perl interpreter is located by the OS kernel and make
substitution variable PERL_SHEBANG available. Does AC_PATH_PROG to find
the path to perl. As a side-effect, that sets PERLINTERP and makes it
available as a substitution variable.

Note: The macro allows for the possibility (expected to be seldom used)
of an explicit user override (the "user" being the operator executing
the final 'configure' script, in this context) by making the option
argument like:

        --with-perl-shebang='#! /my/funky/perlpath' # OR
        --with-perl-shebang='/my/funky/perlpath'  # we just throw away the #! anyway
                                                  # bec it must be absent in Makefile

Rationale: The are various ways of starting an interpreter on different
*nix-like systems. Many use the simple

       #!/usr/bin/perl

but it could be instead

       #!/usr/local/bin/perl

and there is even the possibility that the user wants

       #!/usr/bin/env perl

to find whichever perl comes first in the current $PATH. This is
preferred by some of us because we run multiple perl installations on
the same box. Adjusting our $PATH then allows us to set precedence over
other perls, even whatever the "house" version is.

Users on very non-unix systems like MS Windows do not have a kernel that
does this kind of thing from the first line of script files, but instead
the perl on their machine is started and merely notices whatever comes
after the interpreter path on this first line of the script (options
like "-w").

Acknowledgement: this macro was in part inspired by Dean Povey's
AC_PROG_PERL_VERSION.

ax_sys_weak_alias
*****************

Synopsis
********

     AX_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS

Description
***********

Determines whether weak aliases are supported on the system, and if so,
what scheme is used to declare them. Also checks to see if aliases can
cross object file boundaries, as some systems don't permit them to.

Most systems permit something called a "weak alias" or "weak symbol."
These aliases permit a library to provide a stub form of a routine
defined in another library, thus allowing the first library to operate
even if the other library is not linked. This macro will check for
support of weak aliases, figure out what schemes are available, and
determine some characteristics of the weak alias support - primarily,
whether a weak alias declared in one object file may be referenced from
another object file.

There are four known schemes of declaring weak symbols; each scheme is
checked in turn, and the first one found is prefered. Note that only one
of the mentioned preprocessor macros will be defined!

1. Function attributes

This scheme was first introduced by the GNU C compiler, and attaches
attributes to particular functions. It is among the easiest to use, and
so is the first one checked. If this scheme is detected, the
preprocessor macro HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_ATTRIBUTE will be defined to 1.
This scheme is used as in the following code fragment:

       void __weakf(int c)
       {
         /* Function definition... */
       }

       void weakf(int c) __attribute__((weak, alias("__weakf")));

2. #pragma weak

This scheme is in use by many compilers other than the GNU C compiler.
It is also particularly easy to use, and fairly portable - well, as
portable as these things get. If this scheme is detected first, the
preprocessor macro HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_PRAGMA will be defined to 1. This
scheme is used as in the following code fragment:

       extern void weakf(int c);
       #pragma weak weakf = __weakf
       void __weakf(int c)
       {
         /* Function definition... */
       }

3. #pragma _HP_SECONDARY_DEF

This scheme appears to be in use by the HP compiler. As it is rather
specialized, this is one of the last schemes checked. If it is the first
one detected, the preprocessor macro HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_HPSECONDARY
will be defined to 1. This scheme is used as in the following code
fragment:

       extern void weakf(int c);
       #pragma _HP_SECONDARY_DEF __weakf weakf
       void __weakf(int c)
       {
         /* Function definition... */
       }

4. #pragma _CRI duplicate

This scheme appears to be in use by the Cray compiler. As it is rather
specialized, it too is one of the last schemes checked. If it is the
first one detected, the preprocessor macro
HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_CRIDUPLICATE will be defined to 1. This scheme is
used as in the following code fragment:

       extern void weakf(int c);
       #pragma _CRI duplicate weakf as __weakf
       void __weakf(int c)
       {
         /* Function definition... */
       }

In addition to the preprocessor macros listed above, if any scheme is
found, the preprocessor macro HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS will also be defined
to 1.

Once a weak aliasing scheme has been found, a check will be performed to
see if weak aliases are honored across object file boundaries. If they
are, the HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_CROSSFILE preprocessor macro is defined to
1.

This Autoconf macro also makes two substitutions. The first, WEAK_ALIAS,
contains the name of the scheme found (one of "attribute", "pragma",
"hpsecondary", or "criduplicate"), or "no" if no weak aliasing scheme
was found. The second, WEAK_ALIAS_CROSSFILE, is set to "yes" or "no"
depending on whether or not weak aliases may cross object file
boundaries.

     AX_TRILINOS_BASE([, MINIMUM-VERSION [, ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])

Description
***********

Test for the Trilinos (http://trilinos.sandia.gov/) libraries.

Provides a -with-trilinos=DIR option. Searches -with-trilinos,
$TRILINOS_HOME, and the usual places for Trilinos installation headers.

Requires that a development branch or released version greater than
MINIMUM-VERSION be found. If not specified, the default minimum version
is 8.0.0.

Supports separately specifying -with-trilinos-include or
-with-trilinos-libdir to override default locations underneath either
-with-trilinos or $TRILINOS_HOME.

On success, adds -Ipath to CPPFLAGS, -Lpath to LDFLAGS, sets the
variable TRILINOS_INCLUDE based on the discovered location of
Trilinos_version.h, and #defines HAVE_TRILINOS. When ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND
is not specified, the default behavior is for configure to fail.

        AX_UPLOAD([ncftpput -v upload.sourceforge.net /incoming %%s])

To add upload support for other custom dists add upload-<TYPE> to
UPLOAD_BIN or UPLOAD_SRC, where <TYPE> is the type of dist that is being
uploaded and add a mapping from <TYPE> to the dist file name in the
format '{<TYPE>=><FILENAME>}' to UPLOAD_TARGETS. For example:

        UPLOAD_BIN += upload-foobar
        UPLOAD_TARGETS += {foobar=>@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.fb}

You can then upload of the src distribution files by running:

        make upload-src

all the binaru distribution files by running:

        make upload-bin

or both by running:

        make upload

     AX_WARNING_DEFAULT_ACLOCALDIR [(dirvariable [,[defsetting][,[A][,[N/A]]]])]
     AX_ENABLE_DEFAULT_ACLOCALDIR [(dirvariable [,defsetting])]

Description
***********

print a warning message if the $(datadir)/aclocal directory is not in
the dirlist searched by the aclocal tool. This macro is useful if some
`make install` would target $(datadir)/aclocal to install an autoconf m4
file of your project to be picked up by other projects.

      default $1 dirvariable = aclocaldir
      default $2 defsetting  = ${datadir}/aclocal
      default $3 action = nothing to do
      default $4 action = warn the user about mismatch

In the _WARNING_ variant, the defsetting is not placed in dirvariable
nor is it ac_subst'ed in any way. The default fail-action $4 is to send
a warning message to the user, and the default accept-action $3 is
nothing. It is expected that a Makefile is generated with
aclocaldir=${datadir}/aclocal

The _ENABLE_ variant however will set not only the $aclocaldir shell var
of the script, but it is also AC-SUBST'ed on default - and furthermore a
configure option "-enable-default-aclocaldir" is provided. Only if that
option is set then $2 default is not set to the canonic default in the a
$prefix subpath but instead $2 default is set to the primary path where
`aclocal` looks for macros. The user may also override the default on
the command line.

     AX_WARNING_DEFAULT_PKGCONFIGDIR [(dirvariable [,[defsetting][,[A][,[N/A]]]])]
     AX_ENABLE_DEFAULT_PKGCONFIGDIR [(dirvariable [,defsetting])]

Description
***********

print a warning message if the $(datadir)/aclocal directory is not in
the dirlist searched by the aclocal tool. This macro is useful if some
`make install` would target $(datadir)/aclocal to install an autoconf m4
file of your project to be picked up by other projects.

      default $1 dirvariable = pkgconfigdir
      default $2 defsetting  = ${libdir}/pkgconfig
      default $3 action = nothing to do
      default $4 action = warn the user about mismatch

In the _WARNING_ variant, the defsetting is not placed in dirvariable
nor is it ac_subst'ed in any way. The default fail-action $4 is to send
a warning message to the user, and the default accept-action $3 is
nothing. It is expected that a Makefile is generated with
pkgconfigdir=${libdir}/pkgconfig

The _ENABLE_ variant however will set not only the $pkgconfigdir shell
var of the script, but it is also AC-SUBST'ed on default - and
furthermore a configure option "-enable-default-pkgconfigdir" is
provided. Only if that option is set then $2 default is not set to the
canonic default in the a $prefix subpath but instead $2 default is set
to the primary path where `pkg-config` looks for .pc files. The user may
also override the default on the command line.

Synopsis
********

     AX_WINT_T

Description
***********

It turns out that MacOS X doesn't guarantee to provide the "wint_t" type
unless you include the strange header <runetype.h> in addition to
<wchar.h>. Consequently, the "do I have a system wint_t?" probe fails
and an alternate gets used. Unfortunately, by the time the program gets
built, one way or another that funny header winds up getting included
and the "#define wint_t unsigned int" patch-up-hack mutilates the
typedef. This macro will get it right.

     AX_WITH_APXS([value-if-not-found], [path])

Description
***********

Locates an installed apxs binary, placing the result in the precious
variable $APXS. Accepts a preset $APXS, then -with-apxs, and failing
that searches for apxs in the given path (which defaults to the system
path). If apxs is found, $APXS is set to the full path of the binary;
otherwise it is set to VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND, which defaults to apxs.

******************

Synopsis
********

     AX_WITH_BUILD_PATH

Description
***********

This macro adds a "-with-build-path" option to the configure script.
This configure option provides a convenient way to add "-I" options to
CPPFLAGS and "-L" options to LDFLAGS, at configure time.

Invoking "./configure -with-build-path=DIR" results in "-I DIR/include"
being added to CPPFLAGS if DIR/include exists, and "-L DIR/lib" being
added to LDFLAGS if DIR/lib exists.

Separate multiple directories using colons; e.g.
"-with-build-path=DIR1:DIR2:DIR3".

**************

Synopsis
********

     AX_WITH_CURSES

Description
***********

Detect SysV compatible curses, such as ncurses.

Defines HAVE_CURSES_H or HAVE_NCURSES_H if curses is found. CURSES_LIB
is also set with the required library, but is not appended to LIBS
automatically. If no working curses library is found CURSES_LIB will be
left blank. If CURSES_LIB is set in the environment, the supplied value
will be used.

There are two options: -with-ncurses forces the use of ncurses, and
-with-ncursesw forces the use of ncursesw (wide character ncurses). The
corresponding options -without-ncurses and -without-ncursesw force
those libraries not to be used. By default, ncursesw is preferred to
ncurses, which is preferred to plain curses.

ax_cv_curses is set to "yes" if any curses is found (including
ncurses!); ax_cv_ncurses is set to "yes" if any ncurses is found, and
ax_cv_ncursesw is set to "yes" if ncursesw is found.

     AX_WITH_DMALLOC

Description
***********

Let the user enable/disable support for the dmalloc library available
from <http://www.dmalloc.org/>.

The macro adds the command-line flag "-with-dmalloc". Furthermore,
"-IPREFIX/include" will be added to "$CPPFLAGS", "-LPREFIX/lib" to
"$LDFLAGS", and "-DDEBUG_DMALLOC" and "-DDMALLOC_FUNC_CHECK" to
"$CPPFLAGS".

To enable dmalloc support in your code, add the following snippet to
your header files:

       #ifdef DEBUG_DMALLOC
       #  include <dmalloc.h>
       #endif

     AX_WITH_MPATROL(DEFAULT)

Description
***********

Integrates the mpatrol malloc debugging library into a new or existing
project and also attempts to determine the support libraries that need
to be linked in when libmpatrol is used.

It takes one optional parameter specifying whether mpatrol should be
included in the project (`yes') or not (`no'). This can also be
specified as `threads' if you wish to use the threadsafe version of the
mpatrol library. You can override the value of the optional parameter
with the `-with-mpatrol' option to the resulting `configure' shell
script.
