	ax_pkg_swig.m4: cosmetic changes

2009-12-16  Matthew William Cox  <matt@mattcox.ca>

	modernize the name of cache variables in ax_ext
	The name space structure for cache variables should now contain _cv_.
	I've left them in the AX name space, so the cache variables used by
	ax_ext are now named ax_cv_...

	ax_enable_builddir: improve quality of generated top-level Makefile
	The top-level Makefile is generated by mangling rules, "a: b".  We
	already avoid mangling "a := b".  But we should also exclude "a = :".

	Apparently this was causing unbalanced parenthesis errors on some
	systems.

	AX_LATEX_*: marked obsolete because of issues with LGPL license
	The AX_LATEX_* family of macros is distributed under the LPGL license.
	Use of that license is discouraged for Autoconf macros, because it might
	impose licensing restrictions on the generated configure script. All
	other macros in the Archive that are licensed under LGPL or GPL feature
	an explicit Autoconf Exception that lifts those limitations, but the
	LaTeX macros did not. Unfortunately, all attempts to contact the author
	with a request to remedy the situation have been been unsuccessful.

	Dropped obsolete macros from the repository.
	These macros have been replaced by newer versions and are no longer required.
	Where applicable, the newer versions feature an AU_ALIAS() forwarder that
	redirects invocations of the obsolete macro to the current one.

	Re-released these macros under LGPL with an Autoconf exception.

2009-08-11  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	Revert "Add AU_ALIAS calls to obsolete macros."
	Commit b456074a0da5f319a512c043e6c5102e078923f4 adds AU_ALIAS calls that
	forward from the obsolete macro names to the new ones. However, at this point
	it's uncertain whether that usage of AU_ALIAS actually works as intended. In
	order to avoid breaking things until the issue has been clarified, the change
	is reverted.

2009-08-11  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Add AU_ALIAS calls to obsolete macros.

	Dropped renamed versions of those macros that were obsolete to begin with.
	The macros AC_CHECK_CURL, AC_CHECK_TAGLIB, AC_COMPILE_WARNINGS,
	AC_PROMPT_USER, AC_PROMPT_USER_NO_DEFINE, and VL_PROG_CC_WARNINGS were
	obsolete and are about to be deleted. There seems to be no point in

	I've modified the code to set LIBS in the stanza which checks to see if
	$vl_cv_lib_readline has been set.  This required resetting LIBS in the
	AC_CACHE_CHECK "COMMANDS-TO-SET-IT" argument so that the appropriate
	libs wouldn't be included twice if there was a cache miss.

	AX_DIST_RPM: Do not break VPATH builds
	AX_DIST_RPM was breaking VPATH builds since it was expecting the spec
	template to be in the build directory during configure time.  Obviously
	this breaks distcheck which checks, among other things, VPATH builds.

	AX_DIST_RPM: Do not hard code the spec template
	The spec template was hard coded in and the macro was ignoring the
	template given by the caller.

	AX_DIST_RPM: Remove use of @NAME@ and @VER@.
	It appears that at one point the previously values were being
	substituted in at make time but this is no longer the case.  Modify the
	example to use the @PACKAGE@ and @VERSION@ variables instead.

	AX_DIST_RPM: Update the example spec file in comment.
	The example should use the `License' tag rather than the legacy `Copyright'
	tag.

2009-04-20  Allan Caffee  <allan.caffee@gmail.com>

	AX_CVS,AX_DIST_MSI: Rewritten to use AX_ADD_AM_MACRO_STATIC.
	These changes have not been tested very well since I don't have the software
	setup to use either one.  It's also worth mentioning that AX_DIST_MSI appears
	to use GNU Make syntax which will cause Automake to complain unless portability
	warnings are disabled.

	Please feel free to modify this patch and commit message as necessary.

	AX_DIST_RPM (and dependent macros) Modified to use AX_ADD_AM_MACRO_STATIC.
	The macros AX_UPLOAD, AX_INSTALL_FILES, and AX_EXTRA_DIST which are often used
	in conjunction with AX_DIST_RPM were also updated to use
	AX_ADD_AM_MACRO_STATIC.

	Thanks go to Ralf Wildenhues for the idea of adding local cleanup and
	distribution targets as prerequisites the *-local/*-hook targets.

	AX_ADD_AM_MACRO_STATIC: Added a new macro and helpers.
	This new macro adds some text to the file aminclude_static.am when *Autoconf*
	is run.  The current macro AX_ADD_AM_MACRO writes text to the file
	`aminclude.am' when _configure_ is run.  Unfortunately this means that a) the
	existing macro append Make code rather than Automake code as the name would
	imply and b) only works for implementations of Make which allow includes, BSD
	Make and GNU Make are the only ones that come to mind.

	Hopefully this new macro will eventually replace the existing one altogether
	because it allows Automake to do the actual work thereby offering more portable
	Makefiles and pushing logic out of configure conditionals and into
	AM_CONDITIONALs.  However, in an attempt to avoid breaking existing Autoconf
	scripts those macros have been left unchanged for the time being.

	AX_PROG_MD5SUM: initial version

2009-04-19  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AUTHORS: updated after recent changes to AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR

2009-04-19  Alan Jenkins  <alan-jenkins@tuffmail.co.uk>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Add support for "dist-bzip2" target and friends
	We already get a special toplevel Makefile rule for "dist", which
	copies the tarball from the build directory to the source directory.

	Many projects publish tarballs compressed using Bzip2 to save a bit
	more bandwidth.  Automake provides a "dist-bzip2" rule for this
	purpose, and many others for different compression methods.
	Unfortunately the rules don't all match the file extensions (dist-bzip
	makes .bz2).  So for dist-foo rules, just copy *all* the tarballs.
	Ugly, but useful.

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Fix "make distclean" toplevel Makefile target
	$ ./configure; make
	...
	MAKE i686-pc-linux-gnu : 0 * distclean
	make[1]: Entering directory `/home/alan/bootup/src/module-init-tools/build'
	rm -f doc/*.tmp manpage.refs manpage.links
	make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/alan/bootup/src/module-init-tools/build'
	MAKE i686-pc-linux-gnu : 0 * distclean (all local builds)
	# rm -r .
	# (sleep 3)
	rm -r .
	rm: cannot remove directory `.'

	The problem is the method used to determine which builddirs are local,
	and therefore should removed by "make distclean".  It relies on them
	starting with "./", but they don't :-).  Instead, we can assume that
	non-local directories will start with "/" or "../".

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Prevent multiple dist-all targets in top-level Makefile
	$ ./configure; make
	...
	Makefile:852: target `dist-all' given more than once in the same rule.

	The macro generates additional X-all targets, meaning "make target X in
	all build directories".  My source Makefile includes a rule like this:

	    dist dist-all: ...

	It gets converted to

	    dist dist-all dist-all:

	When what we really want is this

	    dist dist-all:

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Fix ":=" assignments in top-level generated Makefile
	The sed script which generates the top-level Makefile from the Makefile
	in the build directory is flawed.  It treats an assignment of the form
	"TESTSUITE := ..." as a makefile rule - because it contains ":".

	$ make
	...
	MAKE  : 1 * TESTSUITE
	make[1]: Entering directory `/home/alan/bootup/src/module-init-tools/build'
	make[1]: *** No rule to make target `TESTSUITE'.  Stop.

	Fix the sed script to skip the rule-related commands for lines which
	contain ":=".  As a cleanup, we can also skip the rule-related commands
	for lines which do not contain ":".  That simplifies those commands,
	because they don't need to test for ":" themselves.

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Fix builds configured from a subdirectory
	I would like to be able to bypass ENABLE_BUILDDIR and configure a
	subdirectory myself, without generating a toplevel Makefile.
	(This is for an unusual automated testsuite which tests behaviour
	with different configure options, and compiles with -DJUST_TESTING
	to build a testable version of the program).

	$ mkdir build; cd build; ../configure
	...
	config.status: executing buildir commands
	config.status: create top_srcdir/Makefile guessed from local Makefile
	config.status: build in yes (HOST=)
	...
	$ cd ..; make
	MAKE i686-pc-linux-gnu : 0 * all-all
	/bin/bash: line 9: cd: yes: No such file or directory
	make: *** [all-all] Error 1

	Also:
	./configure --disable-builddir
	...
	config.status: executing buildir commands
	config.status: keeping top_srcdir/Makefile from earlier configure
	...

	Which should really be:

	config.status: executing buildir commands
	config.status: leaving top_srcdir/Makefile untouched

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Fix path for config.guess
	Using this macro, I get a warning that config.guess can't be found.
	It doesn't cause a problem for me because I'm not cross-compiling
	for multiple hosts, but it is annoying.

		$ ./configure
		...
		$ make
		sh: Can't open ../config.guess
		...

	Reason: ".." is "$AUX".
	The top-level makefile is generated *after* the configure script reruns
	itself in the build directory.  At that point, AUX is equal to "..".

	Solution: use AM_AUX_DIR_EXPAND to generate an absolute version of
	ac_aux_dir.

	AX_BOOST_{THREAD,PROGRAM_OPTIONS}: replace non-portable shell constructs

	macro files contain similar stuff but I'm not using any other boost libs so I'd
	rather not mess with them.

	AX_C99_INLINE: initial version
	The macro determines whether the "inline" keyword of a C99 compiler is
	standards compliant or not.  I am using this macro support differences
	between gcc 4.2 (and earlier) and gcc 4.3 (and later) when using the
	"-std= c99" option.  It may also be useful for other compilers.  (For
	details of the differences between the compiler versions refer to
	http:// gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/porting_to.html "Sematic change of extern
	inline")

	Example configure.ac:

	  AC_INIT([foo], [0.1])
	  AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

	  AC_PROG_CC
	  AC_PROG_CC_C99
	  if test "$ac_cv_prog_cc_c99" == "no"; then
	    AC_MSG_ERROR([A C99 compiler is required.])
	  fi

	  AX_C99_INLINE

	  AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])
	  AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
	  AC_OUTPUT

	Example source file foo.h:

	  #ifdef HAVE_C99_INLINE
	  inline int myFunction(int a) { return a + 1; }
	  #else
	  static inline int myFunction(int a) { return a + 1; }
	  #endif

	Example source foo.c:

	  extern inline int myFunction(int a);

	AX_PROG_DOXYGEN: bugfix
	A collegue of mine recently ran into a problem: some "[]" syntax appear

	it should have. In some circumstances, it looks like the bug is `mostly
	silent' (save for some bogus output in config.log), but we have seen
	autoconf fail as a result of the "[]" being taken as an (invalid)

	AC_SET_VERSIONLEVEL: obsolete macro
	This macro appears to be broken. Any attempt to use, i.e.

	  AC_SET_VERSIONLEVEL([foo], [1.1.1])

	results in an error message: "m4_popdef: undefined macro: foo_MICRO". If
	someone knows how to fix this problem, please let me know.

	AX_SET_VERSION_INFO: obsolete macro
	To the best of my understanding, this macro is based on a misconception
	about Libtool's -version-info flag. 

	Apparently, the macro invocation AX_SET_VERSION_INFO([2.4.18]) is
	transformed into "-release 2" and "-version-info 4:18". However, those
	two flags contradict each other. The -release option specifies a version
	number in the sense that we all know and love, but -version-info does
	not: that flag implements a fairly sophisticated scheme meant to express
	binary interface compatibility which is supposed to *replace* -release
	versions. Deriving settings for both of those flags from one number
	doesn't make sense. 

	See "6.2 Libtool's versioning system" for further details.

2008-04-12  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	ALL: updated m4 distribution format
	The markup format distributed by the Autoconf Macro Archive underwent
	the following changes:

	 * All archive entries use '#' comment delimiters, rather than 'dnl',
	   because we would like those comments to go into the generated
	   configure script. It should be simple for everyone to determine
	   where the macro came from originally, who wrote it, and where the
	   latest version can be retrieved. To achieve this, every macro used
	   to start with a distinguished line that shows the URL of its
	   respective home page, i.e.:

	   | ##### http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/ax_prog_acme.html

	   As it happens, the aclocal utility distributed with Automake
	   ignores all comment lines that start with a double hash '##', thus
	   those home page URLs will not make it into any automatically
	   generated aclocal.m4 file. Duh. To remedy the situation, the
	   following markup is now used instead:

	   | # =================================================================
	   | #        http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/ax_prog_acme.html
	   | # =================================================================

	 * The 2.x versions of the GNU GPL and LGPL contain the following
	   clause:

	   | You should have received a copy of the <GNU LICENSE NAME> along
	   | with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
	   | Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

	   Version 3.x, however, smartly refers the reader to the Web:

	   | You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
	   | along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

	   This patch changes all GPL2 and LGPL2 macros to do the same, i.e.
	   to refer to the GNU web site for the full text of the respective
	   license. 

	 * Since all m4 files had to be changed in this commit anyway, the
	   opportunity was used to increase the auto-fill column for
	   documentation from 65 to 75 characters per line. It's a trivial
	   change, but it just looks nicer.

	Major re-factoring of Perl, Guile, Python, and Ruby detection macros.

	that macro, trivial wrappers are provided for finding installed versions of
	Perl, Guile, Python, and Ruby.

	NOTE: The earlier version of AX_WITH_PYTHON performed a version check. The
	AX_WITH_PROG-based macros don't do that. Instead, separate macros are available
	for Perl, Guile, Python, and Ruby that check the version of a given executable
	in a second, independent step.

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Bump modification date to obsolete the reverted version.

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Revert renaming of variable HOST to BUILD.
	Further discussion on the Autoconf mailing list has reached the
	following consensus: although BUILD is the right choice in most
	cases, in case of cross-compilation it is not. Cross-compilation
	needs HOST to be set, so the original version of this macro is
	the safer choice. This patch reverts commit
	41da8f494cd209a9836ebeae8f211cb84dde9153.

	An unpleasant property of HOST is that most shell environments
	define that variable to the local hostname. When configure uses
	$HOST as a default setting, however, that is not what it expects
	to find -- HOST is supposed to be config.guess tripple. Thus, the
	user is forced to specify HOST explicitly or to undefine $HOST in
	the shell before calling configure. That's a bit of mess. Bright
	ideas and patches are welcome.

	AX_COMPILER_VENDOR: added support for Pathscale compiler

2007-08-09  Julian Cummings  <cummings@cacr.caltech.edu>

	AX_F90_MODULE_FLAG: drop support for -module flag
	It turns out that in Version 3.0 of the Pathscale Fortran
	compiler they have "clarified" the meaning of the -module flag to
	only be for setting the directory where *.mod files are written.
	In version 3.0, you can only use -module once in a command line,
	and if you use it, then the compiler will look there first for
	module files to be read before looking in the -I directories.
	Thus, it really is best to just use the -I flag here and let the
	user add one specific -module option only if they want or need to
	redirect module output files.

	This commit reverts 5ba234dd8f69456238e7718d4f3a7c116639e373.

	AX_F90_MODULE_FLAG: support -module PGI compiler flag
	I have "-module " to the list of compiler options that is tried
	in order to support the PGI Fortran compiler. Without this
	change, the PGI compiler actually accepts "-I" and passes the
	test. However, this option is actually meant for setting the
	include file search path to find files that are included with the
	Fortran INCLUDE statement. Although the -I flag works in this
	case because there are no -module options on the command line,
	things will not work correctly if the user does bring in the
	-module option on the actual compile command line.

2007-08-04  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR_UNAME: Obsoleted.

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Renamed variable HOST to BUILD.
	The patch universally replaces "host" with "build" and "HOST"
	with "BUILD". The rationale is that typically the user wishes to
	segregate builds based upon the BUILD target rather than the
	configuration HOST type. Now that these host and build variables
	are treated as more fully distinct in Autoconf, it makes sense to
	honor this distinction.

	ax_boost_base.m4: recognize macports installation
	The update reflects that boost library is installed in /opt/local
	for mac users when using macports (macports.org). I got the
	advice from Ernest Turro.

	AX_BOOST: obsoleted in favor of modular macros
	The macro AX_BOOST is deprecated. All users should use
	AX_BOOST_BASE and the specific macros like ax_boost_date_time.m4,
	etc.

	AX_BOOST_*: adapted for naming convention in Boost version 1.34

	AX_BOOST_ASIO: initial version
	The asio library is not yet a part of the latest boost library
	collection, but will be shipped with version 1.35.

	AX_C___ATTRIBUTE__: fixed for gcc4
	The macro did not work with current gcc. The problem is that gcc4
	does not swallow nested function, so the declaration and
	definition of the test function had to be moved from the body of
	main() to the prologue of conftest.c.

	ax_boost*.m4: fix library detection when compiling with -pedantic
	When running the Boost macros with the "-pedantic" compiler
	switch, they fail. It seems that the problem is a multiply
	defined "main" function in the generated test program. I changed
	the call to AC_CHECK_LIB to use "exit" instead of "main", which
	seems to work reliably.

	AX_TLS: initial version
	The attached macro attempts to detect compiler support for TLS
	storage class extensions and how to use that extension. It then
	defines the macro TLS to the keyword it found.

	AX_BOOST_*, AX_PYTHON: Michael Tindal's e-mail address is invalid.
	The address <mtindal@paradoxpoint.com> no longer works because the

	how to reach Michael these days, please let me know. Thanks to Mikael
	Lepistö for bringing this problem to my attention.

	Bug fix for Solaris 9.
	One of our users noticed some strange output on Solaris 9 from
	this macro. It looks like it was a fairly trivial typo, executing
	$1 (a list of headers) instead of $2 (optional shell commands).

	ax_boost*.m4: Portability improvements.
	Joerg Sonnenberger reported a problem:

	 | This fails on a number of systems because in
	 |
	 |     AC_CHECK_LIB($ax_lib, main, [BOOST_REGEX_LIB=$ax_lib break])
	 |
	 | the BOOST_REGEX_LIB a local variable for break. Can you fix

	 | in native mode for example.
