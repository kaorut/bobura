Synopsis

     AX_ABSOLUTE_HEADER(HEADER1 HEADER2 ...)

Description
***********

Find the absolute name of a header file, assuming the header exists. If
the header were sys/inttypes.h, this macro would define
ABSOLUTE_SYS_INTTYPES_H to the `""' quoted absolute name of
sys/inttypes.h in config.h (e.g. `#define ABSOLUTE_SYS_INTTYPES_H
"///usr/include/sys/inttypes.h"'). The three "///" are to pacify Sun C
5.8, which otherwise would say "warning: #include of /usr/include/...
may be non-portable". Use `""', not `<>', so that the /// cannot be
confused with a C99 comment.

Synopsis

     AX_AFS

Description
***********

This sets up the proper includes and libs needed for building programs
that link with AFS. It adds a -with-afsdir option that lets you specify
where the AFS includes and libs are (defaulting to /usr/afsws).

It also adds the -I and -L options to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS

It creates an AC_SUBST(AFSWS) that contains the directory being used.

It checks for -lBSD, -lsocket and -lnsl since AFS needs those if they
exist. It also adds -R/usr/ucblib -L/usr/ucblib -lucb if on Solaris.

It sets VICE_ETC_PATH to be the directory where /usr/vice/etc lives,
since AFS 3.4 uses a different define than AFS 3.5 does for that path.

Finally, it defines AFS_int32 to be the in32 type needed. In older
versions of afs it was 'int32', and in newer versions it's 'afs_int32'.

Synopsis

     AX_AM_JOBSERVER([default_value])

Description
***********

Enables the use of make's jobserver for the purpose of parallel building
by passing the -j option to make.

The option -enable-jobserver is added to configure which can accept a
yes, no, or an integer. The integer is the number of separate jobs to
allow. If 'yes' is given, then the is assumed to be one more than the
number of CPUs (determined through AX_COUNT_CPUS). If the value of no is
given, then the jobserver is disabled. The default value is given by the
first argument of the macro, or 'yes' if the argument is omitted.

This macro makes use of AX_AM_MACROS, so you must add the following line

       @INC_AMINCLUDE@

to your Makefile.am files.

     AX_ARG_WITH_PATH_STYLE

Description
***********

_AC_DEFINE(PATH_STYLE) describing the filesys interface. The value is
numeric, where the basetype is encoded as 16 = dos/win, 32 = unix, 64 =
url/www, 0 = other

some extra semantics are described in other bits of the value,
especially

      1024  accepts "/" as a dir separator
      2048  accepts ";" as a path separator
      4096  accepts "," as a path separator

the macro provides a configure' -with-path-style option that can be
used with descriptive arg names. If not explicitly given, the $target_os
will be checked to provide a sane default. Additional (lower) bits can
be used by the user for some additional magic, higher bits are reserved
for this macro.

the mnemonic "strict" or "also" is used to instruct the code that
additional seperators shall be accepted but converted to the seperator
of the underlying pathstyle system. (or-512)

      example: --with-path-style=win,slash
               to make it accept ";" as pathsep, and
               both "/" and "\" as dirseps.

***********************

Synopsis
********

     AX_AUTO_INCLUDE_HEADERS(INCLUDE-FILE ...)

Description
***********

Given a space-separated list of INCLUDE-FILEs, AX_AUTO_INCLUDE_HEADERS
will output a conditional #include for each INCLUDE-FILE. The following
example demonstrates how AX_AUTO_INCLUDE_HEADERS's might be used in a
configure.ac script:

         AH_BOTTOM([
           AX_AUTO_INCLUDE_HEADERS([sys/resource.h invent.h sys/sysinfo.h])dnl
         ])

The preceding invocation instructs autoheader to put the following code
at the bottom of the config.h file:

         #ifdef HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H
         # include <sys/resource.h>
         #endif
         #ifdef HAVE_INVENT_H
         # include <invent.h>
         #endif
         #ifdef HAVE_SYS_SYSINFO_H
         # include <sys/sysinfo.h>
         #endif

Note that AX_AUTO_INCLUDE_HEADERS merely outputs #ifdef/#include/#endif
blocks. The configure.ac script still needs to invoke AC_CHECK_HEADERS
to #define the various HAVE_*_H preprocessor macros.

Here's an easy way to get from config.h a complete list of header files
who existence is tested by the configure script:

        cat config.h | perl -ane '/ HAVE_\S+_H / && do {$_=$F[$#F-1]; s/^HAVE_//; s/_H/.h/; s|_|/|g; tr/A-Z/a-z/; print "$_ "}'

You can then manually edit the resulting list and incorporate it into
one or more calls to AX_AUTO_INCLUDE_HEADERS.

     AX_BERKELEY_DB([MINIMUM-VERSION [, ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to find Berkeley DB. It honors MINIMUM-VERSION if
given.

If libdb is found, DB_HEADER and DB_LIBS variables are set and
ACTION-IF-FOUND shell code is executed if specified. DB_HEADER is set to
location of db.h header in quotes (e.g. "db3/db.h") and
AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED is called on it, so that you can type

          #include DB_HEADER

in your C/C++ code. DB_LIBS is set to linker flags needed to link
against the library (e.g. -ldb3.1) and AC_SUBST is called on it.

Synopsis
********

     AX_BLAS([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro looks for a library that implements the BLAS linear-algebra
interface (see http://www.netlib.org/blas/). On success, it sets the
BLAS_LIBS output variable to hold the requisite library linkages.

To link with BLAS, you should link with:

     	$BLAS_LIBS $LIBS $FLIBS

in that order. FLIBS is the output variable of the
AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS macro (called if necessary by AX_BLAS), and is
sometimes necessary in order to link with F77 libraries. Users will also
need to use AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN (see the autoconf manual), for the same
reason.

Many libraries are searched for, from ATLAS to CXML to ESSL. The user
may also use -with-blas=<lib> in order to use some specific BLAS
library <lib>. In order to link successfully, however, be aware that you
will probably need to use the same Fortran compiler (which can be set
via the F77 env. var.) as was used to compile the BLAS library.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a BLAS library is
found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it is
not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
define HAVE_BLAS.

     AX_BLAS_WITH_F77_FUNC([ACTION-IF-FOUND-AND-PASS[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND-OR-FAIL]])

Description
***********

These macros are intended as a supplement to the AX_BLAS macro, to
verify that BLAS functions are properly callable from Fortran. This is
necessary, for example, if you want to build the LAPACK library on top
of the BLAS.

AX_BLAS_F77_FUNC uses the defined BLAS_LIBS and Fortran environment to
check for compatibility, and takes a specific action in case of success,
resp. failure, resp. cross-compilation.

AX_BLAS_WITH_F77_FUNC is a drop-in replacement wrapper for AX_BLAS that
calls AX_BLAS_F77_FUNC after detecting a BLAS library and rejects it on
failure (i.e. pretends that no library was found).

ax_c_compile_value
******************

Synopsis
********

     AX_C_COMPILE_VALUE (COMPILE-VALUE, ALIAS, INCLUDES)

Description
***********

The AX_C_COMPILE_VALUE macro determines a compile time value by
generating the object code and reading the value from the code. Static
data initializers like sizeof(int) are unavailable to preprocessor. The
macro calculates the values known to compiler's static initializer.

Assumptions: The sought value should not exceed 65535. The shell
interpreter and the sed utility are expected to exist and work similarly
across possible build platforms.

Result: The resulting configure script will generate the preprocessor
symbol definition:

       #define COMPILE_VALUE_<ALIAS> <NUMBER>

It was important that the value was embedded into the object file in a
predefined byte order during the test. This ensured that the result was
independent from the target platform's byte order.

The existing AC_CHECK_SIZEOF macro also computes the size of the given
type without running the test program. However, the existing macro will
produce a piece of configure script that will take the time proportional
to the logarithm of the sought value.

Example of use in configure.in:

       AX_C_COMPILE_VALUE(sizeof(int), sizeof_int)
       AX_C_COMPILE_VALUE([sizeof(int[[543]])], sizeof_int543)

As a result of runnfing the generated configure script, the following
definition will appear in config.h:

       #define COMPILE_VALUE_SIZEOF_INT 4
       #define COMPILE_VALUE_SIZEOF_INT543 2172

******************

Synopsis
********

     AX_C_DECLARE_BLOCK

Description
***********

The macro will compile a test program to see whether the compiler does
allow new variable declarations in the middle of a C statement block,
i.e. after some non-declaration line. New compilers will allow that
which makes the behave a bit more like C++ - the gcc did support it for
quite a time already.

#define DECLARE_BLOCK_NEEDED says they need to be at the beginning of of
a statement block. Additionlly two defines DECLARE_BLOCK { and
DECLARE_END } are being set. That makes it possible to do the following
in your source code (which this macro is really made up for):

      #define ___ DECLARE_BLOCK
      #define ____ DECLARE_END

      int f() {
       char buffer[1024];
       fgets(buffer, 1024, stdin);
       ___ int i; int ii = strlen(buffer);
       for (i=0; i < ii; i++) {
          fputc(buffer[i], stdout);
       }____;
      }

**************************

Synopsis
********

     AX_C_FLOAT_WORDS_BIGENDIAN([ACTION-IF-TRUE], [ACTION-IF-FALSE], [ACTION-IF-UNKNOWN])

Description
***********

Checks the ordering of words within a multi-word float. This check is
necessary because on some systems (e.g. certain ARM systems), the float
word ordering can be different from the byte ordering. In a multi-word
float context, "big-endian" implies that the word containing the sign
bit is found in the memory location with the lowest address. This
implemenation was inspired by the AC_C_BIGENDIAN macro in autoconf.

The endianess is detected by first compiling C code that contains a
special double float value, then grepping the resulting object file for
certain strings of ASCII values. The double is specially crafted to have
a binary representation that corresponds with a simple string. In this
implementation, the string "noonsees" was selected because the
individual word values ("noon" and "sees") are palindromes, thus making
this test byte-order agnostic. If grep finds the string "noonsees" in
the object file, the target platform stores float words in big-endian
order. If grep finds "seesnoon", float words are in little-endian order.
If neither value is found, the user is instructed to specify the
ordering.

     AX_C_REFERENCEABLE_PASSED_VA_LIST

Description
***********

Checks whether f(va_list va){ &va; } works as expected.

This macro uses compile-time detection and so is cross-compile ready.

C99 mentioned passing a pointer to va_list to other functions (footnote
212 of "7.15 Variable arguments <stdarg.h>"). However, f(va_list va) {
&va; } produces broken pointer on some environments such as gcc on
x86_64, although { va_list va; &va; } works as expected. See the
detection code of this file and any of pages
http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/html_node/Function-Portability.html,
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14557, and
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20951 for further
information.

Although C99 does not define the operations f(va_list va) { &va; } and
&va itself as standard (footnotes are declared as "normative part,
information only"), certain situations need it. This macro provides a
type detection about va_list implementation to deal with the operation.

Following workaround will probably work on such environments although it
does not ensure to be safe and portable. At least it is working on
x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:

      f(va_list va)
      {
        va_list *vap;

      #if HAVE_REFERENCEABLE_PASSED_VA_LIST
          vap = &va;
      #else
          vap = (va_list *)va;
      #endif

************************

Synopsis

     AX_caolan_SEARCH_PACKAGE(PACKAGE, FUNCTION, LIBRARY LIST, HEADERFILE [, ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

Provides -with-PACKAGE, -with-PACKAGE-include and -with-PACKAGE-libdir
options to configure. Supports the now standard -with-PACKAGE=DIR
approach where the package's include dir and lib dir are underneath
DIR, but also allows the include and lib directories to be specified
seperately

adds the extra -Ipath to CFLAGS if needed adds extra -Lpath to LD_FLAGS
if needed searches for the FUNCTION in each of the LIBRARY LIST with
AC_SEARCH_LIBRARY and thus adds the lib to LIBS

defines HAVE_PKG_PACKAGE if it is found, (where PACKAGE in the
HAVE_PKG_PACKAGE is replaced with the actual first parameter passed)
note that autoheader will complain of not having the HAVE_PKG_PACKAGE
and you will have to add it to acconfig.h manually

************

Synopsis
********

     AX_CC_MAXOPT

Description
***********

Try to turn on "good" C optimization flags for various compilers and
architectures, for some definition of "good". (In our case, good for
FFTW and hopefully for other scientific codes. Modify as needed.)

The user can override the flags by setting the CFLAGS environment
variable. The user can also specify -enable-portable-binary in order to
disable any optimization flags that might result in a binary that only
runs on the host architecture.

Note also that the flags assume that ANSI C aliasing rules are followed
by the code (e.g. for gcc's -fstrict-aliasing), and that floating-point
computations can be re-ordered as needed.

Requires macros: AX_CHECK_COMPILER_FLAGS, AX_COMPILER_VENDOR,
AX_GCC_ARCHFLAG, AX_GCC_X86_CPUID.

     AX_CFLAGS_AIX_OPTION (optionflag [,[shellvar][,[A][,[NA]]])

Description
***********

AX_CFLAGS_AIX_OPTION(-qubicle) would show a message as like "checking
CFLAGS for aix/cc -qubicle ... yes" and adds the optionflag to CFLAGS if
it is understood. You can override the shellvar-default of CFLAGS of
course. The order of arguments stems from the explicit macros like
AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL.

The cousin AX_CXXFLAGS_AIX_OPTION would check for an option to add to
CXXFLAGS - and it uses the autoconf setup for C++ instead of C (since it
is possible to use different compilers for C and C++).

The macro is a lot simpler than any special AX_CFLAGS_* macro (or
ax_cxx_rtti.m4 macro) but allows to check for arbitrary options.
However, if you use this macro in a few places, it would be great if you
would make up a new function-macro and submit it to the ac-archive.

      - $1 option-to-check-for : required ("-option" as non-value)
      - $2 shell-variable-to-add-to : CFLAGS (or CXXFLAGS in the other case)
      - $3 action-if-found : add value to shellvariable
      - $4 action-if-not-found : nothing

note: in earlier versions, $1-$2 were swapped. We try to detect the
situation and accept a $2=~/-/ as being the old option-to-check-for.

Currently this macro knows about GCC, Solaris C compiler, Digital Unix C
compiler, C for AIX Compiler, HP-UX C compiler, IRIX C compiler, NEC
SX-5 (Super-UX 10) C compiler, and Cray J90 (Unicos 10.0.0.8) C
compiler.

       - $4 action-if-not-found : nothing

Note: in earlier versions, $1-$2 were swapped. We try to detect the
situation and accept a $2=~/-/ as being the old option-to-check-for.

There are other variants that emerged from the original macro variant
which did just test an option to be possibly added. However, some
compilers accept an option silently, or possibly for just another option
that was not intended. Therefore, we have to do a generic test for a
compiler family. For gcc we check "-pedantic" being accepted which is
also understood by compilers who just want to be compatible with gcc
even when not being made from gcc sources.

     AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL [(shellvar [,default, [A/NA]])]

Description
***********

Try to find a compiler option that enables most reasonable warnings.

For the GNU CC compiler it will be -Wall (and -ansi -pedantic) The
result is added to the shellvar being CFLAGS by default.

Currently this macro knows about GCC, Solaris C compiler, Digital Unix C
compiler, C for AIX Compiler, HP-UX C compiler, IRIX C compiler, NEC
SX-5 (Super-UX 10) C compiler, and Cray J90 (Unicos 10.0.0.8) C
compiler.

      - $1 shell-variable-to-add-to : CFLAGS
      - $2 add-value-if-not-found : nothing
      - $3 action-if-found : add value to shellvariable

********************************

Synopsis

     AC_CHECK_ALIGNED_ACCESS_REQUIRED

Description
***********

While the x86 CPUs allow access to memory objects to be unaligned it
happens that most of the modern designs require objects to be aligned -
or they will fail with a buserror. That mode is quite known by
big-endian machines (sparc, etc) however the alpha cpu is little-
endian.

The following function will test for aligned access to be required and
set a config.h define HAVE_ALIGNED_ACCESS_REQUIRED (name derived by
standard usage). Structures loaded from a file (or mmapped to memory)
should be accessed per-byte in that case to avoid segfault type errors.

AX_CHECK_CLASS tests the existence of a given Java class, either in a

*Warning*: its success or failure can depend on a proper setting of the
CLASSPATH env. variable.

Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission. The
general documentation, as well as the sample configure.in, is included
in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.

Synopsis

     AX_CHECK_GD

Description
***********

Check for the gd library. (See http://www.boutell.com/gd/) If gd is
found, the output variables GD_CFLAGS, GD_LDFLAGS and GD_LIBS will
contain the compiler flags, linker flags and libraries necessary to use
gd; otherwise, those variables will be empty. In addition, the symbol
HAVE_GD is defined if the library is found, and the symbols HAVE_GD_GIF,
HAVE_GD_JPEG and HAVE_GD_PNG are defined if the lirbary supports
creating images in gif, jpeg and png formats, respectively.

The user may use -with-gd=no or -without-gd to skip checking for the
library. (The default is -with-gd=yes.) If the library is installed in
an unusual location, -with-gd=DIR will cause the macro to look for
gdlib-config in DIR/bin or, failing that, for the headers and libraries
in DIR/include and DIR/lib.

Feedback welcome!

Synopsis

     AX_CHECK_GNU_MAKE()

Description
***********

This macro searches for a GNU version of make. If a match is found, the
makefile variable `ifGNUmake' is set to the empty string, otherwise it
is set to "#". This is useful for including a special features in a
Makefile, which cannot be handled by other versions of make. The
variable _cv_gnu_make_command is set to the command to invoke GNU make
if it exists, the empty string otherwise.

Here is an example of its use:

Makefile.in might contain:

         # A failsafe way of putting a dependency rule into a makefile
         $(DEPEND):
                 $(CC) -MM $(srcdir)/*.c > $(DEPEND)

         @ifGNUmake@ ifeq ($(DEPEND),$(wildcard $(DEPEND)))
         @ifGNUmake@ include $(DEPEND)
         @ifGNUmake@ endif

Then configure.in would normally contain:

         AX_CHECK_GNU_MAKE()
         AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)

Then perhaps to cause gnu make to override any other make, we could do
something like this (note that GNU make always looks for GNUmakefile
first):

         if  ! test x$_cv_gnu_make_command = x ; then
                 mv Makefile GNUmakefile
                 echo .DEFAULT: > Makefile ;
                 echo \  $_cv_gnu_make_command \$@ >> Makefile;
         fi

Then, if any (well almost any) other make is called, and GNU make also
exists, then the other make wraps the GNU make.

Synopsis

     AX_CHECK_JAVA_PLUGIN(<shell-variable>)

Description
***********

This macro sets <shell-variable> to empty on failure and to a compatible
version of plugin.jar otherwise. Directories searched are /usr/java/*
and /usr/local/java/*, which are assumed to be j{dk,re} installations.
Apply the shell variable as you see fit. If sun changes things so
<jre>/lib/plugin.jar is not the magic file it will stop working.

This macro assumes that unzip, zipinfo or pkzipc is avialable (and can
list the contents of the jar archive). The first two are assumed to work
similarly enough to the infozip versisonms. The pkzipc version is
assumed to work if I undertstand the documentation on pkware's site but
YMMV. I do not have access to pwkware's version to test it.

ax_check_page_aligned_malloc
****************************

Synopsis
********

     AX_CHECK_PAGE_ALIGNED_MALLOC

Description
***********

Some operating systems (generally, BSD Unix variants) lack a
posix_memalign function, a memalign function, and a working (meaning,
the memory can be freed) valloc function. To make up for it, the malloc
function promises to return page-aligned addresses if more than one
page's worth of memory is allocated. AX_CHECK_PAGE_ALIGNED_MALLOC checks
for this condition and defines HAVE_PAGE_ALIGNED_MALLOC if the condition
holds.

As an aside, note that valloc'd memory cannot safely be freed on all
operating systems. (Again, some flavors of BSD are the troublemakers.)
It's best to avoid using valloc in favor of posix_memalign, memalign, or
an aligned malloc as detected by AX_CHECK_PAGE_ALIGNED_MALLOC.

Caveat: AX_CHECK_PAGE_ALIGNED_MALLOC takes a probabalistic approach. If
100 calls to malloc all return page-aligned addresses, it assumes that
all calls will behave likewise. It is therefore possible - albeit
extremely unlikely - that AX_CHECK_PAGE_ALIGNED_MALLOC can return a
false positive.

Synopsis
********

     AX_CHECK_PGSQL_DB([DB], [USER], [HOST], [PASSWORD], [ACTION_IF_FAILED], [ACTION_IF_OK])

Description
***********

This macro checks wether we can connect to a PostgreSQL server with the
given data. The macro AX_PROG_PGCLIENT is required by this one. The
variable $pgclient_call is set for later use in Makefiles, if you'd like
to make use of this, you must do

         AC_SUBST(pgclient_call)

after having called AX_CHECK_PGSQL_DB. You can then do something like
the following in your Makefile.am:

         @pgclient_call@ -f file.sql

If you want the user to set the data, you should support something like
these configure options:

         AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-host,
                 [  --with-pgsql-host=HOST               server is running on HOST @<:@local socket@:>@],
                 [pg_host=$withval], [pg_host=])

         AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-db,
                 [  --with-pgsql-db=DATABASE             use DATABASE @<:@tarantoola@:>@],
                 [pg_db=$withval], [pg_db=tarantoola])

         AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-user,
                 [  --with-pgsql-user=USER               use USER @<:@postgres@:>@],
                 [pg_user=$withval], [pg_user=postgres])

         AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-password,
                 [  --with-pgsql-password=PASSWORD       use PASSWORD @<:@none@:>@],
                 [pg_password=$withval], [pg_password=""])

You can then call the macro like this:

         AX_CHECK_PGSQL_DB([$pg_db], [$pg_user], [$pg_host], [$pg_password], [AC_MSG_ERROR([We need a database connection!])])

Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission. The
general documentation, as well as the sample configure.in, is included

Synopsis

     AX_CHECK_SIGN (TYPE, [ACTION-IF-SIGNED], [ACTION-IF-UNSIGNED], [INCLUDES])

Description
***********

Checks whether TYPE is signed or not. If no INCLUDES are specified, the
default includes are used. If ACTION-IF-SIGNED is given, it is
additional shell code to execute when the type is signed. If
ACTION-IF-UNSIGNED is given, it is executed when the type is unsigned.

This macro assumes that the type exists. Therefore the existence of the
type should be checked before calling this macro. For example:

       AC_CHECK_HEADERS([wchar.h])
       AC_CHECK_TYPE([wchar_t],,[ AC_MSG_ERROR([Type wchar_t not found.]) ])
       AX_CHECK_SIGN([wchar_t],
         [ AC_DEFINE(WCHAR_T_SIGNED, 1, [Define if wchar_t is signed]) ],
         [ AC_DEFINE(WCHAR_T_UNSIGNED, 1, [Define if wchar_t is unsigned]) ], [
       #ifdef HAVE_WCHAR_H

     AX_CHECK_STRCSPN

Description
***********

Not all systems have strcspn(3). See if we need to substitute. To make
this work, you have to do horrible things. In one of your Makefile.am
files, you must make an explicit rule to make this object. It should
look like this:

       strcspn.lo : $(top_srcdir)/compat/strcspn.c
           $(LTCOMPILE) -o $@ -c $(top_srcdir)/compat/strcspn.c

and you must include "@COMPATOBJ@" in a LIBADD somewhere and, finally,
you must add another artificial dependency, something like:

       makeshell.lo : genshell.c @COMPATOBJ@

It is all pretty horrific, but I have found nothing else that works.

Synopsis

     AX_CHECK_ZLIB()

Description
***********

This macro searches for an installed zlib library. If nothing was
specified when calling configure, it searches first in /usr/local and
then in /usr. If the -with-zlib=DIR is specified, it will try to find
it in DIR/include/zlib.h and DIR/lib/libz.a. If -without-zlib is
specified, the library is not searched at all.

If either the header file (zlib.h) or the library (libz) is not found,
the configuration exits on error, asking for a valid zlib installation
directory or -without-zlib.

The macro defines the symbol HAVE_LIBZ if the library is found. You
should use autoheader to include a definition for this symbol in a
config.h file. Sample usage in a C/C++ source is as follows:

       #ifdef HAVE_LIBZ
       #include <zlib.h>
       #endif /* HAVE_LIBZ */

******************

Synopsis
********

     AX_COMPARE_VERSION(VERSION_A, OP, VERSION_B, [ACTION-IF-TRUE], [ACTION-IF-FALSE])

Description
***********

This macro compares two version strings. Due to the various number of
minor-version numbers that can exist, and the fact that string
comparisons are not compatible with numeric comparisons, this is not
necessarily trivial to do in a autoconf script. This macro makes doing
these comparisons easy.

The six basic comparisons are available, as well as checking equality
limited to a certain number of minor-version levels.

The operator OP determines what type of comparison to do, and can be one
of:

      eq  - equal (test A == B)
      ne  - not equal (test A != B)
      le  - less than or equal (test A <= B)
      ge  - greater than or equal (test A >= B)
      lt  - less than (test A < B)
      gt  - greater than (test A > B)

Additionally, the eq and ne operator can have a number after it to limit
the test to that number of minor versions.

      eq0 - equal up to the length of the shorter version
      ne0 - not equal up to the length of the shorter version
      eqN - equal up to N sub-version levels
      neN - not equal up to N sub-version levels

When the condition is true, shell commands ACTION-IF-TRUE are run,
otherwise shell commands ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. The environment
variable 'ax_compare_version' is always set to either 'true' or 'false'
as well.

Examples:

       AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[lt],[3.15.8])
       AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15],[lt],[3.15.8])

would both be true.

       AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq],[3.15.8])
       AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15],[gt],[3.15.8])

would both be false.

       AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq2],[3.15.8])

would be true because it is only comparing two minor versions.

       AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq0],[3.15])

would be true because it is only comparing the lesser number of minor
versions of the two values.

Note: The characters that separate the version numbers do not matter. An
empty string is the same as version 0. OP is evaluated by autoconf, not
configure, so must be a string, not a variable.

The author would like to acknowledge Guido Draheim whose advice about
the m4_case and m4_ifvaln functions make this macro only include the
portions necessary to perform the specific comparison specified by the
OP argument in the final configure script.

     AX_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF(TYPE [, HEADERS [, EXTRA_SIZES...]])

Description
***********

This macro checks for the size of TYPE using compile checks, not run
checks. You can supply extra HEADERS to look into. the check will cycle
through 1 2 4 8 16 and any EXTRA_SIZES the user supplies. If a match is
found, it will #define SIZEOF_`TYPE' to that value. Otherwise it will
emit a configure time error indicating the size of the type could not be
determined.

The trick is that C will not allow duplicate case labels. While this is
valid C code:

          switch (0) case 0: case 1:;

The following is not:

          switch (0) case 0: case 0:;

Thus, the AC_TRY_COMPILE will fail if the currently tried size does not
match.

macro's usage:

          AC_TYPE_SIZE_T
          AC_CHECK_TYPE(ssize_t, int)

          #ifdef HAVE_UNISTD_H
          #include <unistd.h>
          #endif
          '

          AX_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF(char)
          AX_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF(short)

*************************

Synopsis
********

     AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS(PATH_LIST)

Description
***********

PATH_LIST is a space-separated list of colon-separated triplets of the
form 'FROM:TO:RESULT'. This function iterates over these triplets and
set $RESULT to the relative path from $FROM to $TO. Note that $FROM and
$TO needs to be absolute filenames for this macro to success.

For instance,

        first=/usr/local/bin
        second=/usr/local/share
        AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS([first:second:fs second:first:sf])
        # $fs is set to ../share
        # $sf is set to ../bin

$FROM and $TO are both eval'ed recursively and normalized, this means
that you can call this macro with autoconf's dirnames like `prefix' or
`datadir'. For example:

        AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS([bindir:datadir:bin_to_data])

AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS should also works with DOS filenames.

You may want to use this macro in order to make your package
relocatable. Instead of hardcoding $datadir into your programs just
encode $bin_to_data and try to determine $bindir at run-time.

This macro requires AX_NORMALIZE_PATH.

**********************************

Synopsis

     AX_COMPUTE_STANDARD_RELATIVE_PATHS

Description
***********

Here is the standard hierarchy of paths, as defined by the GNU Coding
Standards:

        prefix
       	  exec_prefix
       	     bindir
       	     libdir
       	     libexecdir
       	     sbindir
       	  datadir
       	  sysconfdir
       	  sharestatedir
       	  localstatedir
       	  infodir
       	  lispdir
       	  includedir
       	  oldincludedir
       	  mandir

This macro will setup a set of variables of the form
'xxx_forward_relative_path' and 'xxx_backward_relative_path' where xxx
is one of the above directories. The latter variable is set to the
relative path to go from xxx to its parent directory, while the former
hold the other way.

For instance `bindir_relative_path' will contains the value to add to
$exec_prefix to reach the $bindir directory (usually 'bin'), and
`bindir_backward_relative_path' the value to append to $bindir to reach
the $exec_prefix directory (usually '..').

This macro requires AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS which itself requires
AX_NORMALIZE_PATH.

Synopsis

     AX_COND_WITH_LEVEL(PACKAGE [,DEFAULT [,YESLEVEL]])

Description
***********

Actually used after an AC_ARG_WITH(PKG,...) option-directive, where
AC_ARG_WITH is a part of the standard autoconf to define a `configure`
-with-PKG option.

This macros works almost like AC_COND_WITH(PACKAGE [,DEFAULT]), but the
definition is set to a numeric value. The level of a simple "yes" is
given (or assumed "2" if absent), otherwise the level can be given in
mnemonic names, being:

      1 = some
      2 = many
      3 = all
      4 = extra
      5 = extrasome more
      6 = extramany muchmore much
      7 = super everything
      8 = ultra experimental
      9 = insane

this macro is most handily it making Makefile.in/Makefile.am that have a
set of with-level declarations, espcially optimization-levels

the $withval shell-variable is set for further examination (it carries
the numeric value of the various mnemonics above)

Synopsis

     AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(FEATURE-NAME, FEATURE-DESCRIPTION, DEFINE, DEFINE-DESCRIPTION, [ACTION-IF-ENABLED [, ACTION-IF-NOT-ENABLED]])

Description
***********

AX_CONFIG_FEATURE is a simple wrapper for AC_ARG_ENABLE, it enables the
feature FEATURE-NAME and AC_DEFINEs the passed DEFINE, depending on the
user choice. DESCRIPTION will be used for AC_DEFINEs. ACTION-IF-ENABLED
and ACTION-IF-NOT-ENABLED are the actions that will be run. A feature is
enabled by default, in order to change this behaviour use the
AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED and AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_DISABLED
macros.

A simple example:

         AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED
         AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_xxxxx, [turns on/off XXXXX support],
         		  HAVE_XXXXX, [Define if you want XXXXX support])

         ...

         AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_DISABLED
         AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_yyyyy, [turns on/off YYYYY support],
                           HAVE_YYYYY, [Define if you want YYYYY support],
         		  [enable_yyyyy="yes"], [enable_yyyyy="no"])
         AM_CONDITIONAL(YYYYY, [test "$enable_yyyyy" = "yes"])

         AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED
         AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(...)

         ...

If you have lot of features and you want a verbose dumping of each user
selection use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE. Use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SILENT in
order to remove a previously AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE. By default
features are silent.

Use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE or AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DISABLE in order to
enable or disable a specific feature.

Another simple example:

         AS_IF([some_test_here],[AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE(feature_xxxxx)],[])

         AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_xxxxx, [turns on/off XXXXX support],
         		  HAVE_XXXXX, [Define if you want XXXXX support])
         AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_yyyyy, [turns on/off YYYYY support],
                           HAVE_YYYYY, [Define if you want YYYYY support],
         		  [enable_yyyyy="yes"], [enable_yyyyy="no"])

         ...

NOTE: AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE() must be placed first of the relative
AX_CONFIG_FEATURE() macro ...

ax_configure_args
*****************

Synopsis
********

     AX_CONFIGURE_ARGS

Description
***********

Helper macro for AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR.

The traditional way of starting a subdir-configure is running the script
with ${1+"$@"} but since autoconf 2.60 this is broken. Instead we have
to rely on eval'ing $ac_configure_args however some old autoconf
versions do not provide that. To ensure maximum portability of autoconf
extension macros this helper can be AC_REQUIRE'd so that
$ac_configure_args will alsways be present.

Sadly, the traditional "exec $SHELL" of the enable_builddir macros is
spoiled now and must be replaced by "eval + exit $?".

Example:

        AC_DEFUN([AX_ENABLE_SUBDIR],[dnl
          AC_REQUIRE([AX_CONFIGURE_ARGS])dnl
          eval $SHELL $ac_configure_args || exit $?
          ...])

Creates a generic PACKAGE-config file that has all the things that you

see ax_path_generic in the autoconf-archive? ;-)

this macros saves you all the typing for a pkg-config.in script, you
don't even need to distribute one along. Place this macro in your
configure.ac, et voila, you got one that you want to install.

oh, btw, if the first arg looks like "mylib -lwhat' then it will go to
be added to the -libs, and mylib is extracted.

the defaults: $1 = $PACKAGE $LIBS $2 = $VERSION there is also an
AC_SUBST(GENERIC_CONFIG) that will be set to the name of the file that
we did output in this macro. Use as:

      install-exec-local:    install-generic-config

      install-generic-config:
         $(mkinstalldirs) $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)
         $(INSTALL_SCRIPT) @GENERIC_CONFIG@ $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)

       PACKAGE_LIBS defaults to -l$PACKAGE_NAME if not set.

The resulting file is called $PACKAGE.pc.in / $PACKAGE.pc

You will find this macro most useful in conjunction with
ax_spec_defaults that can read good initializers from the .spec file. In
consequencd, most of the generatable installable stuff can be made from
information being updated in a single place for the whole project.

ax_create_stdint_h
******************

Synopsis
********

     AX_CREATE_STDINT_H [( HEADER-TO-GENERATE [, HEDERS-TO-CHECK])]

Description
***********

the "ISO C9X: 7.18 Integer types <stdint.h>" section requires the
existence of an include file <stdint.h> that defines a set of typedefs,
especially uint8_t,int32_t,uintptr_t. Many older installations will not
provide this file, but some will have the very same definitions in
<inttypes.h>. In other enviroments we can use the inet-types in
<sys/types.h> which would define the typedefs int8_t and u_int8_t
respectivly.

This macros will create a local "_stdint.h" or the headerfile given as
an argument. In many cases that file will just "#include <stdint.h>" or
"#include <inttypes.h>", while in other environments it will provide the
set of basic 'stdint's definitions/typedefs:

       int8_t,uint8_t,int16_t,uint16_t,int32_t,uint32_t,intptr_t,uintptr_t
       int_least32_t.. int_fast32_t.. intmax_t

which may or may not rely on the definitions of other files, or using
the AC_CHECK_SIZEOF macro to determine the actual sizeof each type.

if your header files require the stdint-types you will want to create an
installable file mylib-int.h that all your other installable header may
include. So if you have a library package named "mylib", just use

          AX_CREATE_STDINT_H(mylib-int.h)

in configure.ac and go to install that very header file in Makefile.am
along with the other headers (mylib.h) - and the mylib-specific headers
can simply use "#include <mylib-int.h>" to obtain the stdint-types.

Remember, if the system already had a valid <stdint.h>, the generated
file will include it directly. No need for fuzzy HAVE_STDINT_H things...
(oops, GCC 4.2.x has deliberatly disabled its stdint.h for non-c99
compilation and the c99-mode is not the default. Therefore this macro
will not use the compiler's stdint.h - please complain to the GCC
developers).

ax_create_target_h
******************

Synopsis
********

     AX_CREATE_TARGET_H [(HEADER-FILE [,PREFIX)]

Description
***********

Create the header-file and let it contain '#defines' for the target
platform. This macro is used for libraries that have platform-specific
quirks. Instead of inventing a target-specific target.h.in files, just
let it create a header file from the definitions of AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM
and put only ifdef's in the installed header-files.

      if the HEADER-FILE is absent, [target.h] is used.
      if the PREFIX is absent, [TARGET] is used.
      the prefix can be the packagename. (y:a-z-:A-Z_:)

The defines look like...

      #ifndef TARGET_CPU_M68K
      #define TARGET_CPU_M68K "m68k"
      #endif

      #ifndef TARGET_OS_LINUX
      #define TARGET_OS_LINUX "linux-gnu"
      #endif

      #ifndef TARGET_OS_TYPE                     /* the string itself */
      #define TARGET_OS_TYPE "linux-gnu"
      #endif

Detail: in the case of hppa1.1, the three idents "hppa1_1" "hppa1" and
"hppa" are derived, for an m68k it just two, "m68k" and "m".

The CREATE_TARGET_H__ variant is almost the same function, but
everything is lowercased instead of uppercased, and there is a "__" in
front of each prefix, so it looks like...

      #ifndef __target_os_linux
      #define __target_os_linux "linux-gnulibc2"
      #endif

      #ifndef __target_os__                     /* the string itself */
      #define __target_os__ "linux-gnulibc2"
      #endif

      #ifndef __target_cpu_i586
      #define __target_cpu_i586 "i586"
      #endif

      #ifndef __target_arch_i386
      #define __target_arch_i386 "i386"
      #endif

      #ifndef __target_arch__                   /* cpu family arch */
      #define __target_arch__ "i386"
      #endif

Other differences: the default string-define is "__" instead of "_TYPE".

Personally, I prefer the second variant (which had been the first in the
devprocess of this file but I assume people will often fallback to the
primary variant presented herein).

NOTE: CREATE_TARGET_H does also fill HOST_OS-defines Functionality has
been split over functions called CREATE_TARGET_H_UPPER,
CREATE_TARGET_H_LOWER, CREATE_TARGET_HOST_UPPER, and
CREATE_TARGET_HOST_LOWER.

      CREATE_TARGET_H  uses CREATE_TARGET_H_UPPER CREATE_TARGET_HOST_UPPER
      CREATE_TARGET_H_ uses CREATE_TARGET_H_LOWER CREATE_TARGET_HOST_LOWER

There is now a CREATE_PREFIX_TARGET_H in this file as a shorthand for
PREFIX_CONFIG_H from a target.h file, however w/o the target.h ever
created (the prefix is a bit different, since we add an extra -target-
and -host-).

     AX_CVS([ANON_CVSROOT])

Description
***********

Adds support cvs targets within your Makefile.

Branching and releasing relies on you using the following version
format:

        MAJOR.MINOR.POINT

where MAJOR is the major version number, MINOR is the minor version
number and POINT is the point release number.

make update

       performs a cvs update

make commitlog

       Generates a ChangeLog template with the modifed, added
       and removed files and opens it up for editing. This is
       not normally used directly, but is instad called by
       commit. It is usefull however if you want to document
       the work you have done, but don't want to commit just
       yet.

make commit

       performs a cvs commit after first performing a cvs
       update and generating a commit log.

make cvs-rm FILES="file1 file2 ..."

       removes a file or files specified by the FILES
       variable from the file system and from cvs. It will
       interactively ask you to confirm the file removal,
       unless the file does not exist on the file system.

make cvs-add FILES="file1 file2 ..."

       adds a file or files specified by the FILES variable
       to cvs.

make branch-major

       creates a branch based on the major version number,
       increments the major version number, sets the minor
       and point versions to zero and checks out the branch
       into a new directory.

make branch-minor

       creates a branch based on the minor version number,
       increments the minor version, sets the point version
       to zero number and checks out the branch into a new
       directory.

make release

       performs a cvs update, followed by a distcheck, then
       creates a release for the current version, increaments
       the point release number and checks out the release
       into a new direcory

make quick-release

       same as release, but distcheck is not performed
